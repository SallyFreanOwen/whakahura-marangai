The song of birds and cicadas filled the air in a place that seventeen months ago was brimming with noise, people, passion and tension as supporters flooded to the land when an eviction notice was served to those occupying it. A breakthrough deal to buy the land follows years of protest involving hīkoi, petitions, court action, a trip to the United Nations, and a lengthy land-occupation. The government yesterday agreed to buy the land from Fletcher Building for just under $30 million - with a commitment for housing to be built on the site. It's the first step in breaking a long-running deadlock. Last night at Ihumātao, frequent visitor Fala Haulangi said she recalled the height of the land occupation in 2019, when there was nearly 100 tents and thousands of protesters on site. \"This place was like, real loud. The community were here, everywhere, taking photos and listening to the history. Church ministers were here, community leaders with the fire going, in the rain,\" Haulangi said. As the sun set on the milestone day for the kaupapa last night, Haulangi and her children were there to congratulate Save Our Unique Landscape (SOUL) - the group at the centre of the protest. \"It's well done for standing up, not giving up. \"It took them six years - not just them, but the communities who came behind them and supported them - finally the government has done the right thing.\" SOUL leader Pania Newton said she had a few similar visitors throughout the afternoon. She described herself as proud and grateful, but said celebrations would need to wait until after a hard-earned sleep. \"We'll take this time to rest and recharge and really process the past six years and gear up for the next phase,\" Newton said. That would involve lots of hui, she said. \"We'll enter into a tikanga process led by the kīngitanga to decide who is mana whenua.\" Yesterday's resolution also brought a close to a memorable chapter in Roger Heta's life. He has been living at the whenua since the first major day of occupation more than 500 days ago, and now considers it home. \"It's been an amazing experience getting to be out in the elements every day, experiencing life, but of course, tautoko-ing the kaupapa which is here, which is the Makaurau marae, the whānau, SOUL, Pania... connecting to the mahi,\" Heta said. SOUL said the deal between the government and Fletchers affirmed international commitments to indigenous rights and the place of tangata whenua in Aotearoa. The parties involved have a five-year time limit to draw up plans, but government Finance Minister Grant Robertson said he expected it wouldn't take that long. He told Morning Report that 'sensitive housing' was the most likely future for the land, but that decision would be thoroughly discussed in a group to be created under the He Pūmautanga Memorandum. \"Working with not just those who affiliate to the Makaura Marae, which includes SOUL, but there are other ahi kā [those with a connection to the land] groups within the Memorandum of Understanding that we've signed, and there's a range of different interests there. \"The discussions we've had, led by the Kingitanga, are that housing along with heritage and cultural aspects appear to be the future of this land. Exactly what that looks like is the subject of the two-stage process that's agreed in the memorandum. \"It's clearly going to be housing that supports the development of mana whenua of the wider Māori community in that area.\" The plans were essentially different to Fletcher's original blueprint for housing at the site because the scale was not so large. \"I don't think it's possible to be able to recognise the heritage and cultural aspects and still be up at that scale,\" he said. The purchase was funded from the government's Land for Housing programme, and earlier this year it was granted level 1 heritage status, both of which weigh on the decision-making. Robertson didn't yay or nay the idea of private housing, but said the memorandum described the most likely options as public housing, housing for kaumātua and kuia, and whānau papakāinga housing. However, he said the government's purchase of the land and plan to work with ahi kā was tailor-made for this situation, and was not intended to be precedent setting.","With a clean-up now in full swing in Napier, the next big challenge will be to find longer-term accommodation for people who can't soon return to their homes. Hawke's Bay Civil Defence has so far assessed 225 homes, and 30 have been found not fit to live in. \"We will have some families who may need quite a significant time in some other sorts of accommodation, and that's going to be a challenge,\" Mayor Kirsten Wise said. \"We've already got 661-odd people in emergency housing. So it will be definitely a challenge trying to find accommodation for the people that have been affected by the flooding as well.\" The evacuation centre will remain open until another option is found, she said. It is a relief for Rachel McGrath, her two children, and partner. Their house in Meeanee flooded on Monday and got up to knee-height. They're currently planning on staying at the Kennedy Park resort until Friday, and after that they have no plans. Their home is in no condition to live in. \"My partner just went to the house, and it's not looking great for anything. He said the house was pretty ruined, he said just everything is destroyed by the water.\" She wasn't at home as the water-level rose Monday night - she was working a night shift at a mental health centre. Since then, they've just been trying to sort everything out. \"Our insurance company on our vehicle have said they don't actually cover floods, so we've got to try and figure that out, but we'll get there. \"If we can get through this we can get through anything really.\" McGrath and her family are just some of the over 100 people who spent the night at the evacuation centre at the park. But the authorities know there are many more who have evacuated from their home, and still haven't gone back. Advice on Monday evening was for people to leave and go to the homes of friends and families, but that has now changed. \"We still have significant capacity, both at Kennedy Park, at the Angus Inn in Hastings, and at the Omahu Marae,\" Wise said. \"We would really like to encourage people, if they are living in cramped environments, to come and approach us, because we can find somewhere else for them to go, and wrap a support package around them.\" The council is now working to proactively find them. \"That's where the Taiwhenua will actually play a really big role because they've got a good network, particularly post-Covid. \"So we'll be tapping into that to try and find the people who we know have vacated their homes, but not quite sure where to.\" The water has gone, but evidence of its devastation remains - cars still strewn across the middle of roads, and silt plastered across pavements. To help people, tip fees will be waived today so those affected can get rid of their destroyed belongings. While most shops, cafes and businesses were able to re-open yesterday - some weren't, and were now having to re-build. Dean Mardon was sent a video late Monday evening by his wife as she walked through his sodden record shop, Electric City Music, on Dalton St. The next morning he arrived, and with the help of his landlord, shifted all 6000 CDs, DVDs and records into a separate location. The day after, he set about ripping up the carpet. \"Basically it's a bare shell, we have to start again.\" Not all his collection has survived. \"Well the stuff that's on the floor, CDs, and boxes, yeah there's some damage there, some old records. \"Damn shame because some of them are really good. I shouldn't have had them on the floor but you know you don't expect an event like this, do you?\" In those suburbs hardest hit by the flooding, cars can once again travel freely. In Marewa, every few houses along, people are beginning to assess the damage, and start to put their sheds back to normal... Regan McCormack balanced an entire freezer on top of his boat late on Monday evening. As the water level rose in the shed, so did the freezer, with McCormack heading out on four separate occasion to ensure it stayed safe. To get it up onto the boat, he enlisted the help of his seven-and-a-half-month pregnant wife. \"I just got $700 worth of venison back from the butcher. So that would have been a bit of a costly loss.\" For some people, what was in the shed was impossible to save. \"I do a lot of craft work to take to the market,\" said Kaye. \"And you can see everything - the water's been that high in here. Everything's just turned upside down, absolutely saturated. All my craft work, gone.\" Kaye's shed has been left in ruins - fabrics, linens, boxes of equipment thrown haphazardly across the room. But her brother, Ray, said the council should have done something about it. This happened as far as I know, nine-and-a-half [or] 10 years ago. Same thing, they've got to get the infrastructure right in Napier. It's just not right.\"","Marae in Napier are opening their doors for anyone affected by the floods. Ngāti Kahungunu has geared into action since the heavy downpour began earlier this week, launching their emergency response teams which were set up during the Covid-19 lockdown. Iwi chair Ngahiwi Tomoana said volunteers had been helping whānau on the ground clean-up damaged properties. \"The marae just geared up automatically and said, 'we're ready, we can take a hundred'. Marae have already set up beds and cooks have been made available,\" he said. \"The rest of the community has kicked in too. We've had some of the other ethnic communities kick in and, because we supported them during Covid, they've been ready to support us back. So it's been quite a merge of communities in support of each other.\" There had been no uptake of marae-stays yet, with many people concerned about leaving their homes, he said. \"A lot of people are reluctant to leave their houses because they don't want to go into hotels, motels and motor camps, but they might be a bit more enthusiastic about going to marae where there's a lot more freedom,\" he said. \"They can take five, six, 10 family members without feeling like they're imposing on anybody, and they have their own mana still intact. We're also talking about some low-decile communities, and a lot of them are afraid to leave their houses and goods because of security reasons.\" He urged them to do so for safety reasons. \"Although there's a bit of euphoria about water and rivers running down the streets and people being out in kayaks and setting white-bait nets up, having a bit of fun, it's also a health risk because the waste water is now mixed into the stormwater,\" he said. \"There are quite severe threats to whānau and to communities if we keep this novelty thing going on and we need to look after the people.\" Tomoana said he was pleased to see different services and groups work together today to support people in need. \"There's quite a good collaboration on at the moment. There was a vacuum of communication at the start where everybody forgot the lessons learnt over Covid that it takes everybody to work in a collaborated fashion, but that's been re-balanced this morning, because a lot of effort was going into some communities and very little was going into others,\" he said. \"The re-balancing is people first and property second and not the other way around.\" Minister for Emergency Services Kiri Allan will be meeting with iwi representatives today to discuss further recovery efforts. Labour MP for Ikaroa-Rāwhiti Meka Whaitiri has also been in the community with gumboots on helping whānau on the ground.","","Flood-hit Napier residents remain on alert as more heavy rain is falling on the city, with another day of rain still to come. Residents are on the edge of their seats waiting for the downfalls to clear, but MetService has forecast heavy rain overnight for the area and until 8pm Wednesday, with rainfall as intense as 75mm/h possible if there are thunderstorms. About 250mm of rain hit the Hawke's Bay city on Monday afternoon and evening, causing slips, flooding low lying suburbs, and rushing through properties. Napier is still under a local state of emergency, and Civil Defence has called on people to avoid any non-essential travel. Anyone in danger is reminded to call 111, and a free phone number has also been set up non-urgent assistance: 0800 422 923. The city's mayor Kirsten Wise says the Kennedy Park evacuation centre remains open, and around 30 people are expected to shelter there tonight. After a day assessing damage to properties, Fire and Emergency NZ says at least 16 properties were uninhabitable, and those families have been evacuated. But it was continuing to assess more properties. Napier Hill and the suburbs of Maraenui, Marewa, Pirimai and Onekawa are the worst hit, and FENZ says damage to some properties is severe. Anyone concerned about their safety has been asked to try to organise safe places to stay with friends or family, but the Kennedy Park evacuation centre remains open to those who need it. Three marae are also on standby to provide emergency shelter, in case more places are needed. There is no boil water notice for the city at this stage, but extra water testing is being carried out by the council, and extra chlorine has been added to the water supply as a precaution. The flood waters have likely been significantly contaminated with sewage, and people should wash their hands thoroughly after touching it, and discard any food that has been in contact with it, including garden vegetables. Anyone whose house was flooded has been warned not to turn on their power or gas until their supplier has checked and told them it's safe to use. The power company Unison says about 140 houses remain without power, down from more than 3000 on Monday night. Crews worked tirelessly throughout Tuesday to reconnect homes and businesses in the flood-hit city, and would continue tonight as long as it was safe and practical to do so. Unison says there is far more significant damage to the network than first anticipated. Meanwhile, the city's wastewater system is still overloaded, and Napier City Council is asking people not take baths, use the dishwasher or flush toilets unless absolutely necessary. And to keep showers short. The storm has been described as a one-in-250 year event. Ongoing Civil Defence updates are available here.","It looks like South versus West Auckland in the battle for Tāmaki Makaurau electorate. Labour's Peeni Henare has held the seat for two terms, winning last election with 48.8 per cent of the 19,777 votes cast. However, his two high-profile rivals, the Māori Party's John Tamihere and the Green Party's Marama Davidson, are backed by solid voter bases in West and South Auckland respectively. People were already queuing this week to cast advance votes at Manurewa library, the polling booth that gave Tāmaki Makaurau MP Peeni Henare more votes than any other in 2017. Mark Adams, 54, from the Hokianga was there voting for the first time ever, and gave two ticks to Labour. \"Seeing what Jacinda's done in the last 12 months with White Island, the shooting and now having to deal with Covid... if she can make a difference as she has, I don't care what anyone says,\" Adams said. \"I know there are a lot of people out there that put her down for what she's done, but I'm alive because of her, my whānau are alive because of her and the things that her and her government have put in place.\" Green co-leader Marama Davidson cast her vote at the same time, with one in 10 of the votes she received at the last election from Manurewa. Davidson said previously she had only fought for the party vote, but this year she was pushing for two ticks. \"Especially if we are standing our female, wahine Māori co-leader in an electorate seat, I personally did not think that we were doing the seat justice by not asking for the candidate vote.\" Davidson hoped people would support her because of her stance on stopping the state removing tamariki Māori from their whānau, on returning land at Ihumātao to mana whenua, and the Green Party policy on constitutional reform, which would action the Matike Mai report. \"The reason why far too many Māori are missing out on an affordable, healthy home is because we haven't designed our decision-making in a way that upholds Te Tiriti and that is key to Matike Mai,\" Davidson said. Across the city in Henderson, Māori Party candidate John Tamihere has delivered social services through the Māori urban authority, Te Whānau o Waipareira Trust, for decades. He stood as a candidate for Auckland's mayoralty and is no stranger to the Tāmaki Makaurau seat, which he held from 1999 to 2005. Tamihere said his campaign crew was recruiting new voters at markets and through \"carkois\". \"We put all the flags on the cars and then you've got all your loud speaker systems and then you drive into all the Māori hoods... and then we bomb major arterial routes so all our Māori party flags, so you're out there just lifting presence,\" Tamihere said. Despite the online backlash, Tamihere said he had no regrets about his party's policy of curbing immigration to free up housing. Waipareira Trust had just finished construction of 120 houses and less than 10 percent had been allocated to his people, he said. \"You think that makes us happy, and my people happy when they see people that've arrived in the country five minutes ago take the best houses, brand new houses, and they're still in caravans and in cars - it's unacceptable,\" Tamihere said. \"So it's not about immigration; it's about the indigenous people having a chance in their own country.\" He hoped his contacts with Māori social service providers in Tāmaki, who regularly meet as the collective, Te Pae Herenga o Tāmaki, would secure him votes from outside West Auckland. Māori warden co-ordinator at the Waipareira Covid-19 testing station, Bumpa, said he was giving two ticks to the Māori party because \"we've got to support Māori.\" \"My wife's family [are] part-relations with the Peeni, so there's a conflict there, but we make sure we keep the kaupapa straight.\" Bumpa said. The campaign crew for Peeni Henare is based at Te Māhurehure marae in Point Chevalier. The marae's founders, Christine and John Panapa, have backed Henare for his last two campaigns. People, especially kaumātua and kuia, often connected Peeni Henare with his grandfather, the late Sir James Henare, Christine Panapa said. Henare said he used his strong Ngāpuhi whakapapa to reach his voters, as 74 percent of those from the northern tribe live in Auckland. As Minister of Civil Defence, he said it had not always been easy to be present in his electorate. \"I was there at Whakaari, I was there at the floods, the droughts, the everything, and some people have said to me, 'well you can't be serving us if you're elsewhere', and that's just one of the honours and privileges of being a Minister, you're responsible for the entire country.\" To those who might criticise him for not being present at Ihumātao, he said he was in the boardroom, trying to fix the problem. \"I might not be standing on the frontline like my tuahine [Marama Davidson], but we were focused on what a positive outcome could be and we still are.\"","New Zealand First leader Winston Peters has used a speech at Orewa to call protesters objecting to a housing development at Ihumātao \"malcontents who got so much unjustified publicity, sticking mainly in the throat of traditional Māori\". He says his party said no to Labour \"three times\" during the search for a solution to the situation at Ihumātao, and refused a request from its coalition partner to invoke the \"agree to disagree\" clause. \"For us, it was a matter of deep principle. For us, it was fundamental to whether we maintained confidence in Labour. So we told Labour that. And staved off any action before the election.\" Peters says Labour will do a deal over Ihumātao if elected - and that deal would cause a \"domino effect\". \"If you don't want a new wave of claims on previously settled Treaty [of Waitangi] claims, it's in your hands... If the Crown weakens its resolve after the election you just watch the flood of action on previously settled Treaty claims. \"All of a sudden new 'sacred ground' will be discovered all around the country. And if that happens the whole Treaty framework will unravel and the cost will be unbearable.\" Peters says Labour leader Jacinda Ardern \"halted the Fletchers housing development at Ihumātao\" without consultation New Zealand First, which should have occurred as per their coalition agreement. \"That intervention was a terrible decision. The land's history was that it was freely sold to Fletchers by the local iwi, the keepers of the land.\" He criticised Pania Newton, who led action to stop the housing development including an occupation of the land, saying she \"sought to overturn a legitimate sale. Worse, she seeks to create an entire new wave of Treaty claims. To perpetuate grievance, to unpick settled Treaty architecture.\" Peters says New Zealand First would stop any \"dangerous settlement at Ihumātao\" if elected. After delivering his speech, Peters was asked why he chose Orewa to deliver his speech, he said: \"Because we are in a campaign and every day we have things to announce. I chose Orewa because this is the place I sought to announce it. There's nothing special about that. Have you got a problem with the people of Orewa hearing the truth?\" He rejected the idea his speech was inspired by Don Brash's 2004 Orewa speech. He was also asked if he was race-baiting with his speech. He replied: \"If you want to make a provocative statement like that as though you don't care about this country's future, you go right ahead. But I'm here saying how important it is for everybody, including Māori, to have a unity pathway forwards. We can't go ahead with this divisiveness.\" And asked if New Zealand First was engaging with an iwi/Kiwi framing because it was getting desperate, Peters said: \"If you want to come along and demonstrate your inability to understand the important issues in this country, you go right ahead. When the election's over, we'll see about people who think like you. \"In this sense, this country can not go forward with the kind of disjunctive, racist misunderstanding of Māoridom. What you're saying to Māori people and Māori tradition is 'We don't care about, we care about wokeism and popularism and separatism and every other thing that's bad for our society'.\" Save Our Unique Landscape (SOUL) is the protest group leading the occupation at Ihumātao and spokesperson Qiane Matata-Sipu says: \"What I have read of his speech ... I did see the content of it. First of all, he is lying. A lot of the kōrero in his speech is absolute lies. And if he is campaigning on lies and scaremongering then that's very dangerous. \"He says in his speech that iwi sold the land to Fletchers. Iwi did not sell the land. Iwi did not own the land. The Wallace family sold the land and they acquired that land after it was confiscated. And that's the first lie that I pick up on. \"The second one is that he says that Pania Newton is not mana whenua. First of all that is clear defamation. It is absolutely an insult and it is completely rude for someone who has no connection to Ihumātao, who has not been here, who does not know our whānau, our whakapapa, our marae hapu or iwi to claim that someone does not whakapapa or does not have mana whenua there. \"I'm hugely not surprised but disgusted at the fact that he has gone out today and just blatantly lied to scaremonger to win votes.\" She said people were still living on the whenua at Ihumātao, and questions about progress towards a resolution would have to be put to the government Labour's finance spokesperson Grant Robertson said: \"If we are in a position to form government next term Labour is committed to continuing our work at Ihumātao and finding a solution with all parties involved. \"We have been working hard with all parties involved and believe we can find a solution next term. Labour wants to thank all the parties involved for their work to date. In particular we want to thank Kiingi Tuheitia and his officials for their leadership in this process.\" It has been well reported that the coalition government was working on a solution and all parties were aware of that, Robertson said.","Analysis - There's a battle brewing in the seat of Northland, with the future of one party potentially riding on the result. The colourful New Zealand First MP Shane Jones is in a fight for his political life, with Labour unwilling to lend a hand. He's up against Labour's Willow-Jean Prime, and the incumbent MP Matt King - both of whom are ahead of Jones in recent polling. Before Auckland re-entered lockdown RNZ political reporter Jo Moir travelled north to meet with the contenders. Northland's not only a potential political lifeline for Shane Jones, but his party, that's been languishing below the crucial 5 percent party vote threshold. He has a battle on his hands, and wants to remind voters of the money poured into the region under the coalition. Jones says National voters don't realise how wasted their vote is if they continue to give it to the blue team under current conditions - in particular in view of Jacinda Ardern's trajectory. Labour, he says, will reward the constituencies that propel it into power if left to govern alone - and Northland won't be one of them. \"The Labour Party and their brilliant communicator Jacinda Ardern have a very lucid and crystal clear strategy to govern by themselves. \"For the Labour Party taking the turtle strategy is rational - maintain a steady and predictable turtle approach - my job as a New Zealand First politician is to flip the turtle over,'' Jones says. The incumbent in Northland is Matt King. He won the seat back for National in 2017 against Winston Peters. The New Zealand First leader secured the seat in a by-election in 2015 after then-Labour leader Andrew Little did a deal and told candidate Willow-Jean Prime to pull back on campaigning. Prime picked up a decent chunk of the vote in 2017, ruining Peters' chances of holding onto the seat, and ensuring it returned to its National roots. She's in the race again this time round and Labour leader Jacinda Ardern says a deal isn't happening. Prime says telling people who they should vote for is \"offensive''. King is surprised but pleased Prime is contesting the election on both counts. \"I felt that they were going to do a deal. They did a deal in 2015, it was all under the table, but it was definitely a deal. \"I thought that's what they'd do again - I'm quite surprised - Willow-Jean is running a two tick campaign and I'm quite happy with that,'' he says. King also sympathises for those in the electorate who feel like they're not getting their fair share. \"I think Northlanders generally feel that they have been a forgotten territory by successive governments and to a degree I agree with that.'' And while Northlanders rejected National's ten bridge promise in 2015, King says they're not fooled by New Zealand First's pork-barrelling. Prime says the odds are stacked against the North. \"We are unfortunately in Northland, and in communities like this, over-represented in the negative statistics in terms of unemployment, welfare dependency, health outcomes, lower educational achievement. I could go on - suicide, incarceration, recidivism - it's a bleak picture,'' Prime says. One aspect that has changed the race for the North is Jones' less bombastic rhetoric. It's intentional after his mother and wife offered the following advice. \"Don't wander around using words that the average voter has no idea what you're talking about, because half the time you sound as if you don't know what you're talking about. \"So yes, I've been given that unwanted advice and hopefully it's evident that I'm starting to follow it,'' Jones says. King says a more subdued Jones makes his job more difficult, because voters respond better to it. The relationship between the three is incredibly warm. Prime and Jones often share cars to announcements and airports. On the day RNZ was interviewing King in Kerikeri he received a text message from Prime asking nicely for details for a candidates' meeting that night, which King happily passed on. Northland is home for all of them and Prime says ultimately she thinks they all care more about the people than the politics. Easy for Prime to say perhaps, given she's in the most comfortable position with a winnable list spot on current polling. Up against a man who already holds the seat but with a party vote that's in decline, and one clinging on to Parliament by his fingernails. There are two types of Northland and the three main candidates vying for the job of electorate MP come 17 October all have their own experiences of both. Matt King is a farmer who lives in Okaihau in South Hokianga. But in an earlier life he was a policeman in the North - his son now is too. King saw the destruction things like methamphetamine, alcohol and domestic violence did to communities in places like Kaikohe. He's seen how both sides live and worked amongst it. Then there's Ngāpuhi's Willow-Jean Prime. She grew up in Moerewa and chose to stay living there despite the reputation that took hold when local industry closed, drug addiction and family violence rose and the town became a place nobody ever stopped in. Prime is one of the lucky ones who has done good - making it onto the Far North District Council before becoming a list MP for Labour at the 2017 election. Her children go to the local school, she spends her time in the town working with community hubs trying to get locals clean and into work and then when Parliament is sitting she lives a different life in Wellington. She takes RNZ to the one and only café in Moerewa for what is a darn good coffee, but she says despite many trying, the store has had multiple owners over the years as the coffee culture doesn't exist for the people of Moerewa and the out-of-towners don't want to stop. It's a far cry from the latte-sipping at Parliament. Then there's the new guy in the race - Shane Jones. He's Te Aupōuri, Ngāi Takoto. Jones is also local and if he can win the seat then the party has a lifeline, and it would almost certainly seal the deal for Jones as the future leader of the party. He lives in Kerikeri too, but grew up in Awanui. His family lives in Mangonui and he himself has land there. Jones is the Māori who went to Harvard University, is one of the most eloquent English speakers Parliament has ever seen, but is just as happy on the marae speaking and translating te reo Māori. He wears a suit more often these days but is more comfortable in gumboots. Kerikeri is fast becoming a Tauranga - the town is constantly growing but rather than it being Northlanders returning home, it's Aucklanders moving north for the quieter life away from the hustle and bustle. While that brings money to the region, it also brings expectations. The wealth divide is stark and while the ratepayer base in Kerikeri and surrounding areas can afford to pay for a new wastewater treatment plant (albeit a very delayed one) - Moerewa residents have just recently, for the third time in a decade, been left to clean up their homes in the wake of flooding. And it wasn't just the river water that poured through their homes, locals were literally sweeping out their own sewage water too. This is just one of the many differences at play. Transport is an issue too. Household cars are few and far between and while a Four Square services the Moerewa area, the more competitively priced larger supermarket chains are in Kerikeri and Kaikohe - both a 20 minute drive away. There's no public transport to help either. Access to affordable food is just one of many factors that ensure poverty-stricken towns remain exactly that - it's a plague that affects many parts of the country. But despite the town being up against inequity, there are dozens of people trying to do their bit to change it. And in many cases they're who you'd least expect. There's recovered methamphetamine addicts running addiction support programmes on the smell of an oily rag. They're hosting community meetings on issues like recent abortion reform, to make sure people are getting correct information rather than the misinformation most fall victim to on social media. Finding somewhere to hold meetings isn't always simple and Prime was left chuckling on the street when the church was offered up as a suggested location for a talk about abortion, because it would fit more people. Then there's Jessie-Lee Reihana - herself three years clean from drugs, and a single mother of three. She opened Fight Fitness Moerewa with her business partner a few months ago but nothing about what they do fits a traditional business model. The gym is about body fit mind and is full of boxing bags and a few other bits of equipment including large tyres and ropes. It's been set up to give recovering addicts something to do to keep their mind from the obvious thing it wants. But it's also to keep the youth off the streets and keep kuia and kaumātua fit and healthy. Half of the classes are designed around the shifts at the local AFFCO, one of the few places people can get work. Some pay in biscuits, some pay a small amount, some don't pay at all. And sausage sizzles are forced to go a long way. But nearby in Paihia, real estate agent Ross Robertson, says his town is suffering too. \"Paihia's had a huge hit with Covid, because we're largely tourism orientated. \"So you're talking about motels that lost all their business overnight,'' he says. Paihia motel owner Julie Barlow says her business was closed for the two month duration of lockdown. \"Trying to run a motel you've got $6000 of recurring expenses - you've still got to pay your rates, still got to pay your power, still got to have your TVs going so you can't just shut that off. \"Starting with weekends we're now getting a few people, but during the week it's very rare,'' she says. With Covid-19 part of the landscape for some time yet, business owners in the North say they just want some certainty about ongoing support. Northland isn't alone on that, ensuring this election will be won and lost on political party's plans for the new normal.","As the flood waters recede in Northland the full extent of the damage from the weekend's deluge is becoming clear. After months of near-crippling drought more than 200mm of rain fell over 10 hours from Friday night. The main road into Kaitaia remains closed by massive slips. The Waiharakeke Stream near Kaikohe has slowed to a raging torrent after bursting its banks and flowing into the small town of Moerewa. Most people have been able to return to their homes, often to find them caked in mud and strewn with debris, and some are uninhabitable. Moerewa residents are becoming sadly accustomed to the floods, which seem to come every couple of years now. Mike Butler is well rehearsed in dealing with the devastating - and dangerous - floods. He spent the weekend sorting out the overflowing septic tanks, checking on vulnerable members of the community and arranging for a tangi to move from the flooded marae to the church. \"We've got this old saying 'it usually takes Mother Nature three days of solid rain, but we wear it on the third day'. There was no rain, but it was the water - the after effects of the overflow of the water from the mountain.\" He is still not sure how many homes have been left uninhabitable by the floods - at least seven in Moerewa but there could be more up the valley, which he hasn't been able to access. On Pembroke St, Skip Kidwell 's family home is still surrounded by water and not for the first time. He thinks this might be the fifth time its flooded. Kidwell has lost faith in the council and government coming to help. \"There's business planning that stops at Whangārei. It doesn't go anywhere up this way. \"They want Whangārei to Hamilton to be one super highway, but there's nothing past Whangārei. Everything stops at Whangārei. No money comes up this way.\" Northland Civil Defence Emergency Management group manager Graeme MacDonald said the flooding was similar to 2014 except the deluge came in a much shorter period. Two families in Whangārei who had to leave their homes are being looked after in alternative accommodation. Council teams have visited 100 homes in Moerewa and found houses and septic tanks have been flooded. McDonald said the council was likely to get the tanks cleaned out to enable people to stay in their homes. Many Northland farmers who've been struggling as a result of the drought now find their paddocks completely under water. There's a vast plain between Whangārei and Kawakawa that could almost be mistaken for a lake if it wasn't for the tops of fence posts and the farm houses on raised ground surrounded by water. Sam Davis runs a cattle farm just north of Moerewa and said his farm was three quarters under water, with little land left to move the cows to higher ground. Ngunguru dairy farmer Matt Long said much of the flat land paddocks were under water and many farms were in the middle of calving. \"This follows on from the worst drought in 50 years, so there's not a lot of feed reserves around for anybody.\" He told Morning Report the 140mm rainfall on Wednesday last week caused minimal flooding compared with the damage caused by the 220m rainfall on Friday. \"There has been some slips on our property but I haven't been further afield because the roads are a bit of a mess.\" Another frustrating result of the flood, he noted, was that fences usually came down and got entangled with debris which took time and money to disentangle. \"When a flood comes down it gathers all the loose grass, leaves, sticks and logs, when it gets to a barrier, they catch on the barrier ... roll up what's there and smash it and break it and deposit it around trees. \"It's something we'll have to fund ourselves.\" Floods closed some of the region's water treatment plants and Whangārei Mayor Sheryl Mai said residents are being asked to conserve water for the next few days. \"The quality of the water coming into the treatment plant is just awful and it takes a lot longer to treat that water. \"The reservoirs are building but we're still asking people just to only use water for cooking, for drinking and for essential hygiene.\" Mai said it was hoped the plants will be operating at normal capacity before the end of the week. Once the extent of the damage was understood, the councils would talk to central government about long-term solutions for flood prevention and repairs to infrastructure, she said. Minister of Civil Defence Peeni Henare visited the region yesterday. Henare told Morning Report that people and property were a priority. Since the waters had started to recede teams had been in Moerewa and Kawakawa to do the assessment, he said. \"I expect in 48 hours to three days we'll have a true picture of exactly what property damage ... people are facing.\" He was in talks with the Whangārei District Council about what a relief package for those affected would look like. \"We're there to support them and we'll do what we can to get them back on their feet,\" he said reiterating comments by PM Jacinda Ardern. State highways in Northland are open this morning, other than through the Mangamuka Gorge, which is expected to be closed for several days. \"The slip isn't down just onto the road but also below the road which makes it a compromised road. Of the over 300 bridges in the Far North, three-quarters of those have already been assessed to date. \"In the next 48 hours, we'll have a true picture of what the impact on the infrastructure is.\" There were a couple of isolated communities with high waters where Civil Defence was assisting, he said.","Bay of Plenty civic leaders are working collaboratively to ensure the region can recover economically from Covid-19. Representatives from the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Tauranga City Council, Rotorua Lakes Council and Kawerau, Ōpōtiki, Taupō, Whakatāne and Western Bay of Plenty district councils met via Zoom on Tuesday to discuss their separate and joint applications to the Crown Infrastructure Partnership Group. The Crown Infrastructure Partnership Group is seeking applications for projects in the public interest, which are \"shovel ready\", that it may fund or accelerate the progress of to stimulate the economy as the country recovers from Covid-19. Regional council chairman Doug Leeder said the challenges of Covid-19 were of an unprecedented scale, and the regional council was focused on its role as an environmental caretaker, as well as supporting the people within its rohe. He said the projects put forward by the regional council would create jobs, encourage environmental sustainability and respond to the threat of climate change. The regional council is seeking funding for the Rangitāiki Floodway, flood resilience projects, \"green work\" projects and regional transport projects. The Rangitāiki Floodway project is in response to the 2017 Edgecumbe flooding. Leeder said the subsequent Cullen report on the flooding noted that the Rangitāiki Floodway project was a \"matter of urgency\" and needed to be completed as soon as possible. The regional council is seeking $13.7 million in funding from the Crown Infrastructure Partnership Group and the project is estimated to employ 50-60 full-time workers. The flood resilience projects cover floodbank development work on the Whakatāne and Waioeka Rivers and new Ngongotahā flood protection works. These projects are expected to cost $12 million across two years and employ 60 full-time workers. Leeder said the work on the Whakatāne and Waioeka Rivers would support both towns' Provincial Growth Fund harbour developments. It would also upgrade drainage in the rivers to go \"above and beyond\" best environmental practice. The \"green work\" projects would include pest control, biodiversity enhancement and wetland development. If successful they would see two million native trees planted. While they had not been approved by regional councillors yet, Leeder said the more than 30 proposed projects in this category could be partly funded by regional council, government, landowners and industry. The regional transport projects were yet to be considered by the public transport committee but could include park-and-ride facilities, transport hubs and rail projects. Ōpōtiki mayor Lyn Riesterer enquired whether people who found themselves unemployed as a result of Covid-19 could find employment in these projects. Leeder said the Rangitāiki Floodway project would be too technical to employ someone who had lost their motel cleaning job, but that people could potentially find employment in the \"green work\" projects. \"We want to get people out of their homes, off the benefit and into the community,\" he said. The Whakatāne, Ōpōtiki and Kawerau district councils put forward a joint table of projects being considered in their districts. These include three waterworks, transport, buildings and structures, parks and reserves, flood protection and cycleways. All up the projects are expected to cost $239 million and employ 2942 full-time workers. Some projects are already underway while others could proceed within six to 12 months. Whakatāne mayor Judy Turner said the projects were economically, socially and environmentally sound and the benefits of them could extend past the district's borders. She said her council was also considering ratepayer relief following both the Whakaari-White Island eruption and Covid-19. Turner said the three councils would continue to work collaboratively with each other and with iwi. Kawerau mayor Malcolm Campbell said councils had a \"huge task\" ahead of them. \"We need to keep positive... there are people hurting out there,\" he said. Leeder told the three Eastern Bay of Plenty mayors that the regional council could assist councils if they came upon any \"minor\" consenting issues that needed to be fast-tracked. However, he noted the councils had been working on the proposed cycleway from Ōpōtiki through to Kawerau and potentially onto Rotorua for over five years and it was therefore well-planned. Riesterer said in a conversation she had with MP Shane Jones she had informed him hold-ups rarely came from councils but rather outside organisations such as the Department of Conservation and Heritage New Zealand. \"It is often them holding up our projects and it was good to express to the minister that they are often the reason for our delays,\" she said. Taupō mayor David Trewavas said his council was looking at three water projects, a civic and welfare centre, an event centre for Tūrangi and an upgrade of sports grounds. Western Bay of Plenty mayor Garry Webber said his council was looking at two major projects including the Rangiuru Business Park Public Infrastructure as well as public infrastructure to support the development of marae and papakāinga housing. He described this as a \"little out of the box\" but essential. Rotorua mayor Steve Chadwick said her council was looking at infrastructure, wastewater treatment plant upgrades and the airport business park development as well as several tourism investments. Riesterer said she saw an emphasis on construction in all councils' plans yet many people who had lost their jobs did not have a construction background. She said councils would potentially have to \"share\" the workforce until more people had been trained. Leeder said councils should not \"underestimate\" the success of the apprenticeship regime and added that many people would need to train on the job. Webber said the biggest limit on all the councils' plans would be the lack of resources available to make them happen. \"The point is, we need to get people into jobs and quickly,\" Leeder said. All mayors said they would like to recognise and congratulate their staff who worked over the Easter weekend to ensure all proposals were ready to be submitted on Tuesday. All councils were expected to submit their proposals to the Crown Infrastructure Partnership Group on Tuesday.

A routine inspection in August last year found deterioration in abutments that posed a serious threat to vehicles crossing the bridge off State Highway 2 about 19km east of Wairoa. The bridge has since been closed to all but pedestrians and all-terrain vehicles. Councillors yesterday agreed to support a recommendation to replace the bridge with a new structure capable of carrying heavy vehicles. Whakakī Marae Trust chairman Bob Solomon said the biggest impact of the closure for tangata whenua had been access to the urupā (cemetery) about 1km on the other side of the bridge. It meant kaumātua (elders) could not travel with tūpāpaku (the deceased) to their final resting place. So far three tangihanga (funerals) and three unveilings had been affected, and the marae's leaders had faced strong criticism from their community over the culturally unacceptable situation, Solomon said. \"We need solutions and we need solutions fast,\" he told councillors at yesterday's full council meeting. \"If that solution is going to take some time, then we need some temporary solution.\" Whakakī Lake Trust chairman Richard Brooking said the community in Whakakī were unanimous in their support for the bridge to be fixed. He was keen to see a new bridge built off-site and shipped in, reducing the amount of time access would be cut off. Although the bridge is on land owned by the Māori Soldiers Trust and farmed as part of Hereheretau Station, it is owned by Wairoa District Council. Records show the bridge was built in the 1950s for flood protection work. A report to councillors by civil engineering firm WSP shows repairing the bridge to the status quo - for vehicles weighing no more than 2.5 tonnes - would be the cheapest upfront solution at $110,000 but further maintenance would be needed in 10-15 years. A new bridge for heavy vehicles, at a cost of $330,000, would not need additional maintenance for at least 40 years. Heavy vehicle access to the area would allow for farmland development and work associated with the restoration of nearby Whakakī Lake. Councillor Jeremy Harker said he supported building a new class 1 bridge but wanted the council to consider how those who would economically benefit from the new bridge could contribute to its cost, thereby reducing the burden on ratepayers. Council's acting transport asset manager Mike Hardie explained the council could reprioritise its work programme to help fund the bridge project through NZTA subsidies, although that would come at the expense of other work the NZTA funding was currently ring-fenced for. Even with the subsidies, the council would be required to come up with 25 percent of the project's cost. Harker said on Mahia Peninsula, Rocket Lab had picked up costs not covered by subsidies for work that benefited the company, but the council retained ownership of roading and was responsible for ongoing maintenance. Councillors have asked for more information on options to pay for the new bridge, including reprioritisation of budgeted work, potential funding partners and loan funding. That information will be presented at the next full council meeting in six weeks. A new class 1 bridge is expected to take five months to construct.

It was announced today that the road from Franz Josef will re-open tomorrow for a guided convoy from 2pm in the afternoon. The news will be a welcome relief to tourism businesses in Franz and Fox Glacier with earlier reports suggesting this vital link to the north would be out for a month or more. Assessments are still being done on the road north of town but at this stage the Transport Agency says an early Christmas present could be on the cards for Franz Joseph tourism businesses. Logan Skinner runs the Terrace Motel, and said with the peak of the season starting on Boxing day, having the route open before Christmas would make a huge difference. \"Appreciate these are very early days and they [contractors] are doing the very best. We got some really, really great roading crews here on the West Coast, work tirelessly we got some absolute brilliant operators and machinery so very thankful to them,\" Mr Skinner said. \"But hopefully once they get into it a bit more, there's bit more certainty around the date, people can make their travel plans and firm that up. And we can be open by the 24th of December they'll be absolutely brilliant, it'd be marvellous.\" While the road to the south could re-open as soon as Friday or even Thursday, Mr Skinner said having it open in both directions was crucial. \"We are in the loop ... most tourists come through Arthur's Pass and leave through Haast, or come through further north and then they leave through Haast or vice versa. Not too many tourists want to drive to a dead end road as further up the top of the coast kind of finds. \"So, you know for us it's very important they can come in and go out the other way.\" Mr Skinner said after three weeks of being cut off in March when the Waiho River took out the main bridge into town, it was important businesses had a good summer this year. West Coast Regional Council chief executive Mike Meehan, who was helping with the civil defence response, said financial assistance for businesses may be available through the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. \"They will be talking to people about how they can potentially help and they will work out the criteria for that,\" Mr Meehan said. \"So businesses will just have to kind of work through that process with them. But yeah, I mean, hopefully there's kind of innovative ways to attract people back here during the the downtime. And I'm sure there's some amazing people down here that'll make that work.\" Meanwhile, the wait continues for the roughly one thousand tourists trapped in Franz Josef. Earlier today, civil defence minister Peeni Henare said if enough people registered as needing to be flown out before Friday due to a lack of travel insurance, having young children or with medical needs, he may call in airforce helicopters to do the job. And later in the afternoon, the government confirmed initial financial support of $100,000 for communities hit by the severe weather at the weekend. The money will go into mayoral relief funds around the country to help with response and recovery efforts. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the disruption, especially for those in hardest hit South Canterbury and the West Coast, had been substantial. She said further government support may be needed once a full assessment of the damage had been done. A defence force P3 Orion is carrying out an aerial survey of the damage and the defence force is also on stand-by to provide travel support if no commercial options are available. Mr Henare's consideration of using the airforce to fly people out of the Franz Josef was welcome news to Chaitany, who was here from San Diego with his wife and two young children. \"Costs for the helicopters are crazy and I don't think I have travel insurance because my card removed the insurance from September 22. They had it and then they removed that part of it. So I'm stuck right now,\" he said. For Chloe Luther and her partner who are hitchhiking around the country, paying hundreds or possibly thousands for a helicopter out of town is not an option either. \"We have a plane in 10 days so we would like to discover more of New Zealand and it's so beautiful here, so we really want to leave because we want to see more so we don't know. It depends on the price because we are backpackers,\" she said. The other town cut off that isn't getting as much attention at the moment is Fox Glacier. Four hundred tourists were led out of there yesterday in a guided convoy. Things are improving a little bit for the locals as well with a generator restoring power there yesterday after two days without lights or hot water. Fox resident Vicky Pengelly flies in to Franz Josef each day for work and was glad to be able to have a hot shower for the first time this morning. \"You know a lot of people are prepared and had their own generators and stuff like that but you know the local shops have assisted everyone like putting things on account and in the garages have been really good in regards to making sure people still have fuel,\" she said. \"So no EFTPOS and we don't have an ATM even if we did have the power on, so yeah, it's a bit of a cash society over there.\" Ms Pengelly said after a power outage in March that lasted four days, it was time something was done to make Fox self sufficient for power in the same way Franz Josef is, and where the lights have stayed on the whole time. A West Coast marae has opened its doors to a whānau of 15 stranded near Franz Josef following flood damage. The whānau were holding a hui at Hunts Beach, near Bruce Bay about one hours drive from Franz Josef, but have been unable to leave because the roads to and from Franz Josef have been washed out. Te Rūnanga o Makaawhio representative Rachel Forsyth said they were using the marae facilities, as they waited to find out when the road will open. \"They've been going down there to use the cooking facilities, and the showers and of course, the laundry.\" Ms Forsyth said another two whānau from the hapū were stuck in Franz Josef for the forseeable future, and she said both parties could be stuck in Haast for days, if not another couple of weeks. A school group from Hokitika who were staying at the marae for two nights end of last week, but were lucky to make it out in time. \"They actually went down to Haast, got stuck for about an hour because there was a bit of a slip there ... so they shot back to the marae, stayed the night, and then shot home the day of the next storm, so ka pai - they got home all safe and sound.\"","The rules governing Māori constituencies are not ensuring balanced representation in communities lacking diversity around the council table. That's the view of the mayor of the only district council in New Zealand with a Māori ward. Now into his fourth term on Wairoa District Council - and his third term as mayor - Craig Little said in his community Māori made up more than 60 percent of the population so were able to elect councillors to represent them, and a Māori ward was unnecessary in this case. Wairoa has the highest level of Māori representation of any council in the country, with five of its seven elected members identifying as Māori. Four of its councillors are women and four are aged under 50. Mayor Little said Local Electoral Act rules meant communities that would benefit from having Māori constituencies did not have them, and a review of the law was sorely needed. In Kaikōura, Whakatāne, Western Bay of Plenty, Manawatu and Palmerston North, council moves to establish Māori wards were rejected last May in referendums prompted by petitions opposing the wards. By law, a petition signed by at least 5 percent of a local authority's population can force a referendum on Māori wards. No other council wards can be challenged in this way. Mayor Little believes his electorate did not receive enough information about the implications of the Māori ward introduced for this year's election. It meant voters could elect only three councillors for the general ward or three councillors for the Māori ward, depending on which electoral roll they were on. Māori ward councillor Melissa Kaimoana said her election campaign ended up being more of an education drive about how the new council structure worked. \"Voters didn't realise the impact the wards would have,\" Cr Kaimoana said. \"Effectively, you could vote for only half of your council. \"People were saying to me, 'I want to vote for you, but you're not on my list.'\" Wairoa voter turnout for the local body elections was down from 63 percent in 2016 to 51 percent this year. Votes were cast by 56 percent of those on the general roll and 45 percent of those on the Māori roll. Although the Māori ward may not be the panacea for Wairoa, which is home to about 8700 people, Cr Kaimoana said it would give Māori an opportunity to have input on \"mainstream\" council business and not just matters concerning iwi, hapū and marae. Māori ward councillor Chaans Tumataroa-Clarke said: \"At the end of the day, we are a Maori voice that will represent the whole community.\" Like Mayor Little, Cr Tumataroa-Clarke thought the Māori ward was unnecessary for Wairoa, and it put him off standing for the council, before he was talked around by whānau and friends. The 27-year-old Anglican minister said the issues that affected Māori were no different to those that affected Pākehā. Although still being inducted into local body politics, Cr Tumataroa-Clarke said he was committed to strengthening the relationship between tangata whenua and the council. Māori ward councillor Danika Goldsack said her decision to stand for the council was entirely dependent on the introduction of the Māori ward, as she felt she would not have been successful in a general ward election. Cr Goldsack hoped to bring both common sense and a Māori perspective to the council table. Wairoa District Council decided to ask voters in 2016 whether they wanted the council to introduce at least one Māori ward for at least the next two local body elections, in 2019 and 2022. The electorate voted 54 percent to 46 percent in favour of the wards. That followed a similar referendum in 2012, prompted by a petition, when the electorate voted against the wards, 52 percent to 48 percent. Between the two polls, an attempt to introduce a Māori ward at New Plymouth District Council was rejected in a 2015 citizens-initiated referendum. Apart from Wairoa District Council, the only other local authorities with Māori constituencies are Waikato Regional Council and Bay of Plenty Regional Council. In Gisborne, where about 50 percent of the population identify as Maori, district councillor Meredith Akuhata-Brown thinks Māori wards could be valuable - improving tangata whenua engagement in local democracy and allowing Māori knowledge to better inform decision-making. Just five of Gisborne District Council's 14 elected members had identified Māori heritage, Cr Akuhata-Brown said. In a statement, Local Government New Zealand president Dave Cull said the way Māori wards were treated differently to other forms of wards was discriminatory. \"Either the poll provisions should apply to all wards or they should apply to none,\" Mr Cull said. In 2017, Green Party MP Marama Davidson's member's bill, which would have kept the process for establishing Māori wards the same as for general wards, was voted down by National, Act and New Zealand First. Don Brash, leader of Hobson's Pledge, which campaigns against \"favouritism\" under the Treaty of Waitangi, said in a media release that opposition to Māori wards at the five councils where referendums were held showed the majority of people did not want the wards. But in an article on The Spinoff website, the director of social justice group ActionStation, Laura O'Connell Rapira, said: \"The rights of a minority group should never be decided by the majority.\" The five referendums last May were always likely to vote down Māori wards \"because there are more Pākehā voters than Māori\". Wairoa Mayor Craig Little received 1973 votes, with challengers Jennifer Takuta-Moses and Waipatu Winitana receiving 179 votes and 521 votes respectively. The district's three general ward seats went to Denise Eaglesome-Karekare - the highest polling candidate with 1190 votes - Jeremy Harker (1137 votes) and Hine Flood (867 votes). The three Māori ward seats went to Chaans Tumataroa-Clarke (661 votes), Melissa Kaimoana (518 votes) and Danika Goldsack (344 votes).

The Overseas Investment Office (OIO) has turned down Tegel's bid to buy more than 200 hectares of former dairy land at Arapohue, near Dargaville. There would have been nine million chickens a year, filling 32 sheds, across 253 hectares in rural Northland. But mass opposition from the Kaipara community and the local authorities' reluctance to issue resource consents has made the proposal too risky for the government to approve. A woman who would have lived just over a kilometre from the site is delighted. \"We are just so relieved,\" Rosie Donovan said. \"This fight has taken over our lives since early February, when we were first notified about it. So it's a huge weight off our shoulders.\" The potential odour from the farm and pollution had residents worried, she said, especially as it was next to the Kāpehu Marae and near to two schools. \"It was also on a flood plain, right next to the Northern Wairoa River, so there were risks with flooding.\" Ms Donovan is thrilled the community's quick thinking and action helped to influence the outcome. The farm would have bordered the Kāpehu Marae, dwarfing its urupā. The marae's chair, Margaret Mutu, also expressed relief the farm has been given the no-go. A farm of that scale would have caused massive health problems, she said. \"We would have been stunk out of the place, we would not have been able to breathe the air, it would have been so polluted. \"It would have killed our people who already have compromised lung capacity.\" She said the company was trying to get away with a \"very dangerous operation\". Ms Mutu said it's time to boost smaller-scale farmers, not back foreign-owned companies like Tegel. Kaipara District Council and Northland Regional Council recommended declining the consents for the farm. But Kaipara Mayor Jason Smith said the rejected farm was a blow to an already-deprived community. \"This particular project was not without its challenges,\" Dr Smith said. It's time the government stepped up support of Kaipara through its provincial growth fund, Dr Smith said. But projects such as this would bring important employment opportunities and increased investment into the area. \"It would send out a signal that we're open for business,\" he said. Mr Smith told Morning Report there are concerns that the government is actively discouraging investment in the district. \"We're not seeing the support that other parts of Northland are seeing from central government in this space.\" \"We've not seen any investment from the Provincial Growth Fund and now a large potential employer into our community is being denied, he said. \"The proposal on the table was talking about 34 jobs.\" This makes Tegal a significant potential employer in Kaipara, he said. \"Our unemployment rate would be running probably at about 6 percent in the community.\" Just a few days ago, the OIO approved a takeover offer for all Tegel shares by a Philippines poultry producer, Bounty. Because Tegel's foreign owned, it's subject to rules that require OIO approval to buy any sensitive land over five hectares. Land Information Minister Eugenie Sage agrees the Kaipara region needs jobs. But she said the wide opposition to the farm, which was to built on sensitive land, outweighed the 18-20 permanent jobs it could have created. \"New Zealanders are leaders in terms of farming,\" she said. \"Overseas investment in rural land has to deliver substantial and identifiable benefits, it can't just be on par with what New Zealand is already doing.\" The sensitive land could have ended up sitting empty, Ms Sage said. \"With considerable uncertainty over whether resource consents could be granted, there was no certainty that the jobs and the increased exports that the company was saying would be associated with the land purchase, would actually be delivered.\" A Tegel spokesperson Liam Baldwin said the decision was disappointing. The farm design was environmentally friendly and efficient, which would be a significant step for chicken farming in New Zealand, he said. Ms Sage said Tegel is able to propose a farm elsewhere but it would need to meet the same standard.","Two adults and their 4-year-old grandchild were stranded on the roof of their Tolaga Bay home for hours after overnight flooding. Tairawhiti Civil Defence controller John Clarke said the family had been on the roof since 4am. \"So that's not a very pleasant experience particularly when there's water through their house and they had lost their woolshed and their cars had been washed away,\" he said. \"They were rescued about 8am and taken to family, the kid is being assessed for possible hypothermia but they are doing OK. \"They have been on the roof for four hours and were very wet and cold. The young girl has been checked by paramedics and was all clear. The family is enjoying having a shower and relaxing after what would have been a traumatic time.\" The family said the experience was traumatic, their granddaughter said it was a \"cool adventure\" but all are extremely grateful to be alive. The floodwaters had swept away the woolshed, a work truck, a car, a digger, tractors and trailers. The grandmother said water had flooded the home and reached a metre from the ceiling. Mr Clarke said the granddaughter had been checked by paramedics for possibly hypothermia, but was given the all clear. Mr Clarke said at least two other homes were flooded - a family of seven including an elderly couple. \"They're in their homes with flooding all around them so we've got helicopters up there assessing that but we very well may have to evacuate them as well. \"There's also about 20-odd people at the Mangatuna marae and we're just watching that too.\" Mr Clarke said rivers in the Tolaga Bay area had risen rapidly since midnight and were close to their peak but had now stabilised. \"Tolaga Bay and the area inland from there we've had a couple of hundred millimetres of rain in the last 24 hours at the top end of Mangatuna River.\" Road closures have shut Tolaga bay residents off from Gisborne. \"The State Highway between Gisborne and Tolaga Bay is closed and so is the road north of Tolaga Bay so there is no road access.\" He said rain was expected to ease in Tolaga Bay but would be heavy over parts of Gisborne. About 20 residents in the area had self-evacuated from Whangara and surrounding areas. State Highway 2 at Mangatuna Road north of Tolaga Bay has been closed and at Whangara, where water has reached the bottom of the Waiomoko Bridge. Civil Defence would remain on standby. Motorists are advised to stay home unless travel is essential. Those that do need to leave are urged to check road information first. Meanwhile, in Kaiti sewage was being discharged to cope with a stormwater overflow. The emergency wastewater valves on the Gladstone Bridge were opened at 8am. The Gisborne District Council said the discharge was diluted but could be a risk to human health.","Twenty-five homeless Hawke's Bay families were forced out of emergency motel accommodation to make way for Art Deco Festival tourists over the last two years. Some of the families who were moved had to sleep in community halls while the festival was on. Documents released to RNZ under the Official Information Act show 10 families had to shift for festival-goers in mid-February, and 15 families were forced to do the same in 2017. Those who were moved on last year were housed in church and community halls in Napier and Hastings, or stayed with family or at marae in Gisborne, the Ministry for Social Development said. \"The ministry worked hard to minimise the impact on its clients and worked with them to secure alternative accommodation,\" ministry deputy chief executive of housing Scott Gallacher said in a written statement. \"The ministry is not away of anyone that had no where to go over the Art Deco weekend.\" The number of transitional houses in Napier and Hastings had increased from 29 to 146 between March and December 2017. Despite this, and work by the ministry to book motels in advance of big events, there was no guarantee homeless families would not be turfed out in the future, Mr Gallacher said. \"Given that the demand is increasing, it's very difficult to absolutely guarantee that we may not need to think about moving families. \"All of what we are doing to increase the supply, is trying to absolutely minimise any further examples of where we are having to shift people out of motels.\" The 2017 Art Deco Festival was followed the next weekend by the Matatini national kapa haka championships, creating an accomodation crisis for many homeless living in emergency motel accomodation. Some of the 15 families who were moved that year stayed at the Salvation Army's church hall in Flaxmere. The families were grateful for a place to stay but it was unsettling for them to be moved about, Salvation Army social services secretary Major Pam Waugh said. \"When you are vulnerable like this and you are living in crisis accomodation, it's not good to have have these upsetting times where you are out for a few days.\" The Salvation Army was working closely with the ministry to place people in alternative accomodation in the first place, especially if they knew a motel would be booked out for an event during their stay, she said. Ten homeless families had to leave their emergency motel accomodation for Art Deco weekend in February this year. Ikaroa-Rāwhiti MP Meka Whaitiri said it was \"not acceptable\" that it had happened again. \"I don't want next year coming around and we're having to do this again. \"Clearly we need to do more.\" Hawke's Bay was not the only region where big events leave put pressure on accomodation for the homeless. In March, families in Whangarei were cast out of their emergency accomodation as Six60 fans flooded the city for a concert.","Edgecumbe residents who lost their homes in a major flood a year ago will have secure housing again, in new homes built on a local marae. About 1600 people were evacuated when a stop bank on the Rangitāiki River at Edgecumbe breached during ex-Cyclone Debbie last year causing the destruction of 15 homes and extensive damage to many others. Up to 78 homes are still awaiting repair. Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta yesterday officially opened five two-bedroom homes at the Kokohinau marae. Ms Mahuta said it was a great community initiative, which would help families receive the help and support they needed to rebuild their lives. She said there was also potential to build more homes on the land. \"Right now there are five there. The Kokohinau Papakainga Trust are keen to continue with phase one which was building ten homes. So we will continue - Te Puni Kokiri will continue to investigate the options for the next five.\" During the opening, Ms Mahuta said one of the new residents was a grandmother who now had the opportunity to rebuild her life. The $2.7 million development was carried out with funding support from the Te Puni Kokiri Maori Housing Network and the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment. Last year, the marae provided emergency food for those affected by the flood.","More than 70 people turned out to a public meeting last night over plans to build New Zealand's biggest chicken farm, south of Dargaville. Tegel Foods is seeking resource consents to raise nine million chickens a year on land that's currently dairy farm at Arapohue. And as word spreads about the plan for a mega chook farm, opposition is mounting. Some residents have agreed to sell their land to Tegel, but the rest are preparing for battle. Lasd night's meeting at Dargaville High School was the fourth this month in the normally placid rural community. Karen Exley, from the hastily-formed Kaipara Community Group, said 99 percent of those who attended were opposed to the chicken farm. \"People come along to the meetings, thinking it might be good for the local economy,\" she said. \"But once they find out what's involved they change their mind.\" Tegel wants to build 32 poultry sheds on farmland 12 km south of Dargaville, near the Northern Wairoa River. Each shed would be almost as long as a rugby field and 20 metres wide, and the farm would be stocked with 1.3 million chickens at a time. Tegel plans to incinerate the waste, and make the farm self-sufficient in energy. Faith McManus, who lives just over the river at Te Kopuru, said it would be an industrial blot on an outstanding landscape and the smell would be unbearable. The Northtec art tutor is one of several artists who have moved to Te Kopuru recently. \"It's a beautiful rural landscape and there are going to be these giant sheds and inside there'll be 41,000 chooks in each shed,\" she said. \"Forty tonnes of chicken poo a day will be going up in the air, and there are two country schools on either side of that.\" Tegel has consulted neighbours of the farm site affected by what's described as a 'smell map' and arranged to buy up several properties. But others living nearby said they had not been consulted. Karen Exley said she and her husband Peter Exley own farm land adjoining the Tegel boundary, and had never heard from the company. \"They've ticked the box for community consultation on the application to the councils, but in our eyes, they've just approached the six closest houses, made them offers and got them to sign confidentiality clauses and promise not to oppose the resource consents,\" she said. There is also concern at the prospect of truck convoys on rural roads as 750,000 chickens a month are taken to slaughter in Auckland. Rosie Donovan, who's lived in the area all her life, said she and her family will be leaving if the farm goes ahead. \"I wouldn't want to stay here. We have health issues with the children in my family, and we work really hard to have clean air and water and good food,\" she said. \"It's just completely against where I saw the Kaipara going, with our little boutiquey shops popping up and cottage industries.\" Ms Donovan said although farming and kumara growing were large-scale activities in the area they did not affect the community in the way the Tegel chicken farm would. Lyn Vincent whose family grow organic kumara and vegetables on 50 hectares not far from the site, said the chicken farm could put them out of business. The Vincents had been organic growers for 25 years she said and employed 35 people, some seasonal but most for long periods during the years. If the Tegel farm went ahead, they'd need three soil audits a year, instead of one, at $1000 a pop, Mrs Vincent said. \"The dust fallout would be what will upset our growing operation, if it leaves any residue of any sort,\" she said. \"They (the organic certifiers) have told us they will scrutinise our audits... if they find residue we lose our organic status and our jobs. That's what we do for a living.\" Karen Exley said that would negate any benefits of the 30-odd new jobs the chicken farm would create. Carol Donovan, anther local said to add to the risks, the Tegel site was on a flood plain. And though it planned to build bunds to keep the water out, it would still need to drain rainfall off the land, into rivers that feed the Kaipara Harbour and its snapper nursery, she said. Mrs Donovan said the location of the chicken farm, right beside State Highway 12 was also a bad look for Northland's Twin Coast tourist route. \"That's in the middle of Tegel's 'smell map'. So the tourists have to go through this horrible odour,\" she said. The company has told the regional council it has spoken to iwi over its plans. But the manager of the nearest marae said no one from Tegel had been to visit and the marae would become unuseable if the chicken farm went ahead. Violet Chapman said there was no way Kapehu marae could function with 1.3 million chickens being raised next door. Mrs Chapman said the marae was a busy one - the smell would be intolerable and so was the prospect of chicken sheds close to the urupa. She said the risk of air and water pollution was also a worry. \"They want to put sheds on the side of the marae and out the back near the urupa,\" she said. \"That means our marae will be out of action. There will be nothing there for us, really - we won't be able to use it, with the noise and the dust and the smell. \" Mrs Chapman said Kapehu marae would be lodging strong objections to the resource consents. Tegel Foods has been asked for comment regarding the level of local concerns but has not yet responded. The Northland Regional Council has had 17 submissions so far on the Tegel application, 16 of them opposed. Submissions close next Wednesday.","A state of emergency has been declared and homes evacuated as ex-tropical cyclone Gita rumbles over the Buller District. Mayor Garry Howard issued the emergency notice shortly before 5pm and said 12 homes at Granity, north of Westport, were being evacuated. Earlier in the day fire crews travelled from Hokitika to Granity to meet the demand of weather-related callouts. Fire and Emergency assistant area commander Stephen Butler said people should evacuate their properties if they could. He said the fire station would be used as a welfare centre, with four Red Cross support crews helping. Schools in the Buller and Grey Districts were closed and Stockton Mine near Westport, which employs 230 people, had been evacuated. NZTA said the main road further south SH6, the coast road from Westport to Greymouth, had been closed due to flooding and strong winds. The agency said it would remain closed until at least 9am tomorrow. Howard earlier warned residents to stay at home, with schools closed and generators being brought in to the region ahead of Gita. Check the latest information in our live blog Read what you need to know for the essential information for your region Get the full picture with our wrap-up of the day's events Send us your weather photos and videos: iwitness@radionz.co.nz The Westland District Council activated its Emergency Operations Centre this morning. A spokesperson said residents were urged to prepare for gale force southeast winds up to 150km/per/hour and all precautions should be taken to secure loose iron and awnings. Council staff and emergency workers were being deployed across the district. Rainfall totals were expected to be in the range of 90mm to 120mm. Brenda Larsen in Granity said she and her husband would be staying put at their beach front property for the time being. \"Sitting watching the waves,\" she said. \"I actually find it quite exhilarating, you know, storms. So many precautions have been made around the district that I think it probably is going to be a big event, but we'll face that when we come to it.\" She said if the weather got too bad they had friends at higher ground they could stay with. Further north at Karamea, farmer Peter Langford said the wind had picked up and it felt like Cyclone Gita had arrived. He said he had moved his excavator into the valley in preparation for fallen trees. \"I don't want to have an excav at the top of the hill and not be able to get down. That happened at Cyclone Ita. \"Just while you're talking to me there's a bit of a wind, a bit of a whistle in the wind now that's getting up, it's lifting quite markedly right now. It's got a real whistle to it and the trees are bending over right now. Yup, we're into it.\" Mr Langford said farmers were worried the storm surge would ruin more pasture and kill off winter feed supplies. At Bruce Bay, south of Fox Glacier township,Te Tauraka Waka a Maui Marae was offering refuge to those who needed it. Susan Wallace of Te Rūnanga o Makāwhio said the hapū members had been preparing for the bad weather for the past couple of days. She said they had been concentraing on making sure their emergency kits were up to date, that they have three days' supply of food and water, and battery power packs for cellphones in case of power cuts. \"Our marae will be available for whanau that are down in that area,\" she said. \"At the end of the day it'll depend on how accessible the roads are should the wind knock any trees over.\" The Department of Conservation had closed coastal tracks and campsites to thousands of visitors. DOC West Coast operations manager Mark Davies said the department was better prepared this time. \"The rainfall is predicted to be heavy but I think we're ready for it, and certainly the storm surges. \"I think we're ready to ensure that people are safe and away from those low-lying coastal areas.\" Mr Davies said DOC had been encouraging the estimated 10,000 visitors currently on the West Coast to move into the region's towns. He said they sent messages to about 2000 campers to warn them about the weather and to advise them to stay in camping grounds.","Audits of school finances have revealed a school that kept money donated for disaster relief in Fiji and another that spent $250,000 on an overseas trip. The auditor-general's report on this year's audits of schools' 2016 finances named four schools that spent large sums on overseas trips for staff and students, and three that spent \"relatively high\" sum on presents for departing principals. The report found multiple faults in Blockhouse Bay Intermediate's accounting - including keeping relief fundraising money after Cyclone Winston devastated parts of Fiji in 2016. \"We drew attention to the school not passing on $3700 collected specifically for Fiji flood victims,\" it said. \"The school kept the funds and used them for school purposes.\" Blockhouse Bay Intermediate was also among the schools to spend high amounts on an overseas trip, paying $26,000 towards the $82,000 cost of a trip to Korea for 18 students and three teachers. The report said Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Hoani Waititi Marae spent $249,632 of school funding on a trip for 251 students, staff, and caregivers to Rarotonga. \"The purpose of this trip was to achieve educational outcomes connected with the founding principles of 'Te Aho Matua,'\" the report said. Another kura, Tamaki Nui A Rua, funded a trip to Rarotonga in 2015 for 27 students, four staff, and four parents, the report said. \"The kura spent $56,246 but collected only $13,294 from those who went on the trip.\" Manurewa West School paid for five staff to visit Kuala Lumpur, as part of a trip to tour schools in Singapore. \"We consider it unusual for schools to fund trips of this nature,\" the report said. \"We are pleased to see that the [Education] Ministry has re-instated its guidance to schools about the need to specifically fundraise for overseas travel for students,\" the report said. The report also named three schools that spent \"relatively high\" amounts on gifts for departing principals. Blockhouse Bay Intermediate spent $7000 for a farewell party and $3000 on a leaving gift for the principal, Kingsford School gave vouchers to the value of $10,000 to the principal as a leaving gift, and Puhinui School gave the departing principal a $8500 ride-on mower when he left the school. \"Spending on farewells and retirements should be both moderate and conservative, and suitable for the occasion,\" the Office of the Auditor General said.","NorthTec students whose courses were about to be axed are celebrating, after a backdown by managers. The polytech was planning to close courses in Visual Arts, and Sport and Recreation, to cuts costs. But after a flood of submissions, it's decided to let students complete their degrees, and keep the courses going if new enrolments warrant it. Marcia Aperahama, who's two years into her degree, said that has come as a huge relief because she couldn't afford to study elsewhere. \"I'd started to think about Plan B - the move to Auckland and how on earth this was going to happen,\" she said. \"Myself and another solo mum on the course were starting to look at the options around flatting and it was pretty horrifying looking at what we were going to have to pay for even a small two-bedroom place.\" The single parent of a three-year-old told RNZ last month she moved to Whangarei to study because she could no longer afford to live in Auckland. Ms Aperahama said the Sport and Recreation course should never have been on NorthTec's chopping block in the first place. The health and wellness industry was a strong and growing one in Northland and graduates had readily found jobs or started their own businesses, she said. Her dream was to start her own health and fitness business tailored for Māori. \"We are just hoping all the bad publicity about the (proposed) closure won't affect enrolment numbers for next year's intake,\" Ms Aperahama said. However NorthTec is standing by its decision to close a number of other courses, and shut down its campuses in Rawene and Kerikeri, and cutting up to 50 staff. The polytech's management told staff it is facing a $4 million loss this year, despite growing student numbers. It had received 164 submissions on the restructuring proposals, a spokesperson said, and the leadership team was encouraged by the depth of community support. Programmes to be scrapped include Business and computing, a construction course being taught at an Auckland marae; Marine Adventure and Eco-Tourism; Manaaki Marae hospitality; and Information Systems. NorthTec said it had hoped to make a decision on next year's Agriculture and Horticulture programme by now but was still waiting for funding decisions from the Tertiary Education Commission.","","People still in their homes in flooded parts of Christchurch along the Heathcote River are being told to stay put for the night. The river broke its banks in the torrential rain, with water covering the neighbouring streets in the suburbs of Beckenham, St Martins and Opawa. The council had earlier advised people in the lowest areas next to the Heathcote to evacuate their homes, but as high tide drew near, just after 3pm, they were advised to stay put if the flood water was above knee high. Attention was now turning to the next high tide, at about 3am. People still in their homes have been advised to stay there, as it would be too dangerous to try and get out in the dark. Those who did evacuate have been told they should not try to return overnight. Christchurch civil defence controller Mary Richardson said the water supply was safe to drink, but people should try to keep their waste water to a minimum as the system was already overloaded. The council said the Coastguard response teams could help people out of their homes if needed. The Coastguard said the vessel was equipped with emergency lighting, wetsuits and first aid supplies, and the crew could continue evacuations into the evening if required. The army was also now providing assistance in Christchurch. A welfare centre has been set up at Linwood College for evacuees. Emergency work has also been undertaken on the banks of the estuary in Southshore. The council said three of four low areas had been filled, but that contractors were unlikely to completed the final area before high tide earlier this afternoon and water was likely to come through. The council says pumps have also been put in place in Southshore to help manage the water. Christchurch Mayor Lianne Dalziel said Heathcote would be a top priority once the flood recovery swings into action. Ms Dalziel said stormwater retention in Heathcote had been done, but it overflowed in the heavy rain. The Minister for Civil Defence said the focus across affected parts of the South Island was now on the response effort - clearing roads, rail and getting people back on their feet. Nathan Guy flew over the flooded plains of Taieri and spoke with local farmers, who said there was likely to be debris from forestry slash. He said it would take some time to get tractors to the affected areas to clear stockpiles of feed. Mr Guy said it came at an unfortunate time for farmers, with the beginning of calving and lambing just around the corner The Heathcote River burst its banks in south Christchurch and wastewater has been flowing into some streets, and the city has declared a state of emergency as a precaution The lower parts of Dunedin airport were flooded by about half a metre of water Dozens of roads around Dunedin have closed. A large slip close to King George Street means access to Portobello and Broad Bay has been cut off Access to Milton was closed with State Highway 1 both south and north of the town blocked by floodwaters Authorities are warning people to stay off the roads in Otago-Southland if they can, saying they had run out of 'Flooding' signs Flood levels at Outram were the second-highest ever recorded for the Taieri River today A large slip forced a number of houses to be evacuated Ravenswood Street in St Clair Otago Civil Defence said rain in the region has eased and rivers are beginning to recede. In Dunedin, waterways were receding with the exception of the Taieri, which was still fluctuating at high levels. The Taieri River was expected to remain high regardless of whether more rainfall occurs, but houses and cribs at the township of Taieri Mouth have been spared after the river peaked below them. Sandbags and rocks have been used to plug most of a hole that was letting water back under the pumphouse at pressure from the Taieri into Mill Creek. There are widespread road closures in Dunedin due to flooding and slips. In Waitaki, there was widespread flooding over many parts of the district and there was some sewage leakage in the Oamaru township. Some local roads were closed and there was damage to some properties. In Central Otago, river levels were receding and weather forecasts showed the rain was clearing, but there were widespread road closures in the Maniototo and Ida Valley, and damage to roads. To share pictures of the weather where you are, email to: iwitness@radionz.co.nz Snow was falling, affecting roads with some closures remaining in place overnight. Sub-zero temperatures overnight in Canterbury and Otago were likely to causing hazardous driving conditions on many routes from about 4am onwards. Transport Agency and council roading crews will be out applying grit, so drivers needed to take care on gritted roads as well as icy road. It was not yet clear whether schools in Otago will open on Monday. There were about 25 slips on roads across the city, many of them on the Otago Peninsula. Ravenswood Street in St Clair was closed and 12 houses have been evacuated due to a slip there. Another slip in Harington Point Road was still shifting and work to clear it will not start until Monday, leaving Otago Peninsula residents north of Harwood cut off. Otakou marae is door-knocking in the area and providing welfare to those who need it. About 100 households in Outram near Dunedin were evacuated overnight, plus about 120 more across the region, as the Taieri River continued to rise. Flood levels at Outram were the second-highest ever recorded for the Taieri River, which was expected to peak about 1pm. Taieri Floodgates opened at a riverflow of 100 cubic metres per second, but flows at 8am had reached 1985 cubic metre per second. People were initially asked to go to emergency centres set up within the town, but about two hours later people at those centres were urged to leave. An army Unimog was shuttling people from Outram to an emergency centre in Mosgiel. Residents in North Oamaru spent the day cleaning out garages, basements, and even houses after yesterday's deluge inundated the town's stormwater network. A record amount of rain fell in the Waitaki district yesterday, forcing people to evacuate their homes. In less than an hour, Walbrook Crescent went from being a wet street to two feet under water. That contaminated water forced an elderly couple out of their house when it flooded yesterday afternoon. The neighbour said contractors only started putting sandbags around it after the water had started receding. In other parts of Oamaru, the only visible reminder of the flooding was the debris washed up driveways, fences, and near the doors of business. And the Humber Street bridge was closed, after the overflowing creek ripped a hole in the tarmac. Early this morning, the Army assisted Civil Defence in rescuing nine people trapped in and on cars on State Highway 87 - the route from Maniototo to Dunedin. A unimog transported the occupants to safety. Troops reassigned from a planned exercise to help with flood relief in Otago and Canterbury are also being helped by a regiment from Scotland. The Scots were due to join a battalion from the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment in a 26 kilometre race around Dunedin's surrounding hills. Brigadier Mike Shapland said about 200 troops were now working with Civil Defence authorities. Brigadier Shapland said five Army trucks left Timaru earlier today to patrol flooded communities in South Canterbury. Taieri river sits alongside Dunedin Airport and chief executive Richard Roberts some low-lying buildings were flooded. \"We've got some buildings with kind of half a metre of water through them in the lower parts of the airport \"We've got a hangar, an engineering workshop that's got water through it as well, there's some rental car garages have got water through them.\" He said the terminal and runway were not affected because they are higher up. Dairy farmers in Otago are being allowed to release small amounts of effluent where storage ponds are at capacity because of the heavy rain. The regional council said many farmers have expressed concern about how to manage them. The council said if possible farmers should get a truck in to pump out effluent. However, it said because these were exceptional circumstances farmers can release some effluent, but only as little as possible. It warned that it was not permission to release entire ponds.","","An emergency housing development is being built at Kokohinau Marae in the Bay of Plenty to house families displaced by the Edgecumbe floods. The government is contributing $2.6 million towards the construction of five two-bedroom homes. One local woman, Lolo Hale, had 22 family members staying at her place during the April floods. She said many of her whānau had to leave the area in order to survive. \"Some of them are living as far as Opotiki or Rotorua. \"We had some families who were living just down the street - they've had to pack their families up and go back to Auckland because they just can't survive.\" She said the new development would help some of the families who want to go back to Edgecumbe. Te Puni Kokiri and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment is working closely with the Pahipoto Māori Committee who have responded to immediate whānau needs affected by the floods. Hemana Eruera, chairman of the committee, said the temporary homes were an immediate response to the devastation they saw during the floods. \"Our hapū, in their sadness and sympathy for all of the people in Edgecumbe and in the surrounding the area that were affected by the flood, thought we'd make an offer to capitalise on the land that is on our marae to put on emergency homes.\" He said they had enough land to expand the development to help even more whānau. \"We've got enough land here to take up another 20 to 30 houses but we'll start with the five, see how the ministry sees it and then we'll move into further additions if the need arises.\" Whakatane District Council recovery manager Julie Gardyn said there was still much to be done in Edgecumbe to help aid families in need. The council will fast-track consent for the new buildings so that families can get in sooner. But Ms Gardyn said the new development would only scratch the surface of what needed to be done to help every family who needs emergency housing. \"We have a long way to go and have around 270 homes in Edgecumbe where people are unable to return at this stage. \"About 250 of those are going through a process where they are drawing out of their homes - a number are living in rental accommodation or other temporary accommodation options.\" Mr Eruera said he was not sure when the temporary housing would be ready for families to move into, but hoped it would be soon. In the meantime, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has temporary housing for families at the Whakatane camp grounds and in portacoms in Edgecumbe.","An Auckland IT company is working on a plan to deliver medicines by drone to isolated communities. Paua Interface director Robyn Kamira helped set up an internet link two years ago to the marae at Mitimiti in north Hokianga. The Te Rarawa woman said that meant people could now consult their GPs online, saving time and money. Picking up medicine is still a problem however, and that's where she said drones could work. \"It's all very well having a GP online to consult with but it's another thing to get the prescriptions out there,\" she said. \"It's a three-hour return trip either to Kaitaia or Rawene - Rawene means a ferry crossing as well, Kaitaia is very rough gravel roads. \"I counted last year about seven or eight flood events where they couldn't even get out. The IT consultant said drones were beginning to be used elsewhere in the world to deliver medicine, and it could be the answer for remote communities in New Zealand. She said her company was working with Civil Aviation to trial the first medical drone flight to Mitimiti in November.","The government is defending its decision to only now offer Edgecumbe residents emergency housing, more than a week after the flood-stricken town was evacuated. Some of the 900 properties affected in Edgecumbe were expected to be completely uninhabitable, and the government today announced that displaced residents could sign up to a service to connect them with temporary accommodation. Residents who had been displaced by the floods could register on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment website. The service has previously been used following the Kaikōura and Christchurch earthquakes. The lead minister for Edgecumbe Anne Tolley said it was likely the service would be needed given the widespread damage. \"We are still assessing the damage to know how many homes will need to be replaced and how many repaired but it is clear assistance will be required for a significant number of families for temporary accommodation,\" Mrs Tolley said. Hotels, baches and holiday homes have all been suggested as places people can stay while their properties are assessed. Building and Construction Minister Nick Smith said he expected hundreds of people would use the service. \"There is a significant number of matches of temporary accommodation that may be able to be accessed, just as there was in Kaikōura. \"We expect about a third of the homes to require some sort of accommodation support.\" However, questions were raised as to why the service was only being announced now, when people had been without homes for over a week. Dr Smith said the government had considered offering the service last week, before realising the scale of Cyclone Cook. \"The level of concern and focus around Cyclone Cook was such that we wanted to have the focus on ensuring that we're managing our way through that. \"Equally so, to get the staff that are available as of tomorrow based in the eastern Bay [of Plenty] has required us to make the financial decisions and get the resources to get that up and running.\" Whakatāne district mayor Tony Bonne said just 14 homes had been red-stickered, but some people faced a further wait before they could get on with the clean up. \"A little bit of a frustration from some people is that some of the insurance assessors haven't given them the all-clear to clean up yet... \"They're saying 'hey, we've got to wait until Tuesday before the assessor can come and and let us through the house',\" he said. However, the Insurance Council said residents could start cleaning up their properties if they took photos of the damage first. Its chief executive Tim Grafton said assessors were on the ground and had been working all weekend. Assessors would be looking at structural damage which might restrict access to the worst affected properties, he said. Meanwhile, volunteers have been working with locals in Edgecumbe to clear properties that were damaged by the flood a week and a half ago. A volunteer co-ordinator in Edgecumbe said the cleanup job was so huge that as long as people were in the town and willing to help, there would be work for them. Tourists from overseas were among the 130 volunteers supporting locals in the flooded Whakatane town yesterday, and the same is expected today. The cleanup is being organised from Ruaihona Marae, and organisers said they were overwhelmed by people's generosity and willingness to help. One of the co-odinators Sarah Omundsen said volunteers were now into the worst-affected areas, which had been very difficult for some. \"[It's ] really hard work, really smelly work and really emotional work too because residents in some cases have just lost everything,\" she said. If people wanted to join the effort, they should register their details on the Bay of Plenty Regional Council website, she said.","An army of volunteers has taken to the streets of flood-stricken Edgecumbe this morning to help with the clean-up. The volunteer initiative is being organised by Ngāti Awa, the district and regional councils, Red Cross and Māori wardens. Dozens of people are filling wheelbarrows with wet carpets, rotten food and flood-damaged furniture and emptying the contents into big skips. Close to 100 volunteers are on the ground helping with the clean-up today, and more are expected to arrive throughout the day and the rest of the weekend. So far more than 540 had registered to help. Efforts were being coordinated out of the local marae, and one of those doing the coordinating, Hakahaka Hona, said he was not surprised by how many people had offered to help. He said volunteers were working closely with whānau to see how they could help, and they had a lot of work ahead of them. \"We're pulling up carpets, removing rubbish, rotten food waste, the dirt and the soot where the diggers and bob cats couldn't get to. \"The streets have all been done with the machinery and the volunteers will take care of the things they couldn't reach, and sorting stuff for the whānau,\" he said. He said volunteers just kept coming to see if they could join in efforts. \"They're still coming in off the street, a lot of whānau don't like to fill out the form and register, so we'll never truly know really how many volunteers are helping\". He said the volunteers would only enter homes they had been welcomed into. \"We're trying stick to looking after the families' interests - only through communication with the families will they go in and clean their house.\" Meanwhile, another 229 Edgecumbe residents were expected to be able to get back to homes this afternoon, though most of them would not be able to stay in the flood-damaged buildings. Edgecumbe residents were also urged not to hose or wash mud and silt into drains as the post-flood clean-up continues. Civil Defence controller Paula Chapman said it could block pipes and cause flooding when further rain came. Residents are advised to pile mud and silt on the berms outside, or near, their properties, for collection. The council is also warning people not to take rubbish to the Whakatāne Transfer Station, which it said was already full of mostly storm-related debris.","Kokohinau Marae in Te Teko has become a food bank to help the families of Edgecumbe who were forced to evacuate by last week's devastating flooding. Hunters from around Bay of Plenty have donated their kills and qualified butchers have donated their skills and time to cut the meat up. Local supermarkets, packhouses and other locals have also donated to the project, which is being called Kaiwaka. The marae is processing all donations and making parcels to give to flood-struck whānau and those who are looking after them until they can go home. The marae kitchen was in full flight today. Men lined the stainless steel benches, sharpening their butchers' knives in preparation for fresh meat. The idea to get hunters involved came from two larger than life personalities: Howard Morrison Jnr and Lotto man Russell Harrison. Mr Morrison said the two were having an orange juice last Friday evening when the images of the flooding began to appear on social media. They jumped into action and decided they could do more than just send their aroha; they could organise relief for their cousins in Bay of Plenty using their hunting contacts. Mr Harrison, who lives in Rotorua, said the whānau in the region were their people too. \"We were both impacted by the vision of what was happening and we wanted to do something about it, these people are from the Bay of Plenty and they're our people too.\" Mr Morrison, who has been the face of television programme Hunting Aotearoa, is a keen hunter, and knew he could inspire others to make donations. He estimated they had been given 10 deer, 10 pigs and a number of donations of lamb and beef. Kawerau mayor Malcolm Campbell arrived with many of the the town's butchers to help, along with skilled locals from Te Teko and surrounding areas. \"We're neighbours, eh,\" Mr Morrison said. \"Te Arawa is just over the hill from the Bay of Plenty.\" The two singers had their own troubles making it from Rotorua to Te Teko. \"We had to navigate through a landslip to get here but, when we got here, we could see they've mobilised so many people,\" Mr Harrison said. \"It's for the people who are housing the families, in one instance I've heard there are 19 adults under one roof - now, that's a lot of pressure on things like power, everyday needs like toilet paper, diapers for kids, and kai,\" Mr Morrison said. The two entertainers, who call each other Harry, have been living up to their reputations - providing a good laugh for those donating their time and, of course, a waiata or two. Kokohinau Marae secretary Wiremu Hunia said all the meat would be inspected by a qualified meat inspector, to make sure it was ready to eat. \"Today we are [processing] meat and dried goods, and tomorrow we will give it to [the] whānau of Edgecumbe.\"","","","About 300 Edgecumbe residents have been able to return to their homes briefly today for the first time since last week's flooding. About 70 percent of properties in Edgecumbe have been flooded to some degree after the Rangitāiki River breached stopbanks on Thursday. That forced about 1600 people to evacuate as about half the town became inundated with water. The township remains largely cordoned off, but the Whakatāne district mayor, Tony Bonne, said people with unaffected homes were given access to them today. They were allowed into their houses for about 15-minutes under escort, so they could collect key items. Anne-Marie Lingard found her home undamaged and was able to stock up on clothes, feed the cat, and rescue lots of food left in the deep freezer. \"I wasn't home when we were evacuated, I was already at work, so I had nothing, my husband was away so he had nothing as well, just what he had with him, so it was just get what we can and get out.\" She said while she was one of the lucky ones it was disheartening to see the flooding elsewhere. Edgecumbe residents who live on the east side of the Rangitāiki River will be able to return to their homes from 8am tomorrow. The cordon will be reduced accordingly. Mr Bonne said the sewerage system still wasn't working, so portaloos and chemical toilets would be available. The houses would have water and power. He said that covered about 45 properties on Hydro Road, Nikau Place, Miro Place and Konini Place. Mr Bonne earlier said it was still to unsafe for people to get full access, with no working power, water or sewerage. \"We have a card system, we're working very closely with the police at the cordons and they'll be escorted onto their properties to get their needs and then come out.\" Early signs are that the schools in Edgecumbe have not been badly damaged by Thursday's massive flooding as they are located on higher ground. But Whakatāne District Council said a proper assessment of the buildings would not happen until tomorrow at the earliest. Officials from the Ministry of Education will be in Whakatāne and Kawerau from Monday to give support and advice to parents with pre-school and school age children. They will be working with the Whakatāne Emergency Response team giving out advice for families whose children are going back to school, and also those who need childcare. The officials be at the Whakatāne War Memorial Hall, Rautahi Marae and Awakeri School. The Eastern Bay of Plenty Area Commander, Inspector Kevin Taylor, said frustrated residents had been turning up at the cordon trying to get in. Mr Taylor said officers at the cordon had been talking to those people and trying to help. A couple of people managed to get through the cordon at night, he said, and they told the officers who caught them on the way out they had been trying to get clothes and other personal items from their homes. Tensions ran high at a public meeting yesterday, where council officials fronted up to about 500 locals who expressed anger about the flooding response. Tempers boiled over with many people shouting out at officials and storming out. Many residents were concerned about when they would be able to return home and were angry the stop banks had failed. Mr Bonne said the frustration was understandable as people grieve. \"I'll be honest, I was floored when I arrived to find no sound system and that put us on the back foot immediately. \"We knew when we walked in that we would be struggling because of the lateness and because of no sound system, so erm, somebody c----d up, \"It's one of those things [where] everybody's under pressure and - one of those things unfortunately.\" Mr Bonne said efforts to give people access to their homes had been increased. Whakatāne District Council chief executive Marty Grenfell said residents should register with the council and they would have to meet with officials individually to explain their needs. Mr Bonne said it would be 10 days before Edgecumbe residents would have full access to their homes. He said ideally he would like people to be able to go back by Easter, but that may not be able to happen as there are health and safety concerns, and houses will need to be inspected. The Transport Minister, Simon Bridges, said restoring road access was the number one priority for small communities that remained cut off after this week's flooding in the Bay of Plenty. Mr Bridges and the Māori Development Minister, Te Ururoa Flavell, visited a number of the isolated settlements, including Ruatahuna, by helicopter this afternoon. Mr Bridges said the damage to the roads was very bad in places, with some completely taken out, or only half the road left. There have also been slips above some of the roads. Mr Bridges said they had told the affected communities the roads would be rebuilt, and they would be working hard this week to provide a timeframe for that. Mr Flavell said the small communities that had been cut off by the flooding were holding up well. He said the locals' spirits were high, despite the circumstances. Mr Flavell said some of these communities have been through this before and wanted to look after each other. He said they seemed to be more concerned about Edgecumbe. Mr Flavell said people in isolated communities wanted to make sure the authorities stay connected with them, particularly on issues like having adequate food and medical supplies.","The breach in the stopbank that left the Bay of Plenty town Edgecumbe inundated with water from the swollen Rangitāiki River has now been closed. Edgecumbe remains cordoned off and empty after the Rangitāiki River breached stopbanks on Thursday, and about 1600 people who evacuated the city. While water levels had stabilised, Whakatāne District Council warned yesterday further evacuations were still possible with floodwaters continuing to flow through swollen rivers and canals in the region. Bay of Plenty Regional Council flood manager Roger Waugh said they were able to close the breach about 11pm. He said that had stopped water pouring through the town and the water levels have dropped in some places, but it was a temporary fix and they would be working to strengthen the stopbank further. \"We saw some initial gains in lowering the water levels in Edgecumbe but there is still a significant amount of water in Edgecumbe. \"We continue today to shore up that temporary breach closure, we've got an operation to lift the bank up and put some more secure work in place.\" Mr Waugh said authorities were beginning to assess when they would be able to begin pumping the water out, but it was hoped that would start today. Edgecumbe was still unpowered and some permanent pump stations had also been affected by floodwaters, by the council was bringing in more pumps from around the country, he said. Whakatāne mayor Tony Bonne said Edgecumbe residents who had been forced out of their homes should prepare to be away for up to 10 days. Some were staying with friends and family, but there is also an evacuation centre in Whakatane. Mr Bonne said there was no power in Edgecumbe at the moment and the sewerage system was not working. There were also health risks from the contaminated floodwaters. Despite Civil Defence saying yesterday that some people might be allowed back today, Mr Bonne today was reluctant to put a timeframe on when that might happen. As sections of the town are given the all clear, people will be allowed back in stages. Civil Defence said they were confident there had not been any looting in the town. Two community meetings will be held today for residents evacuated from their homes. The first will be held at 4pm at Rautahi marae in Kawerau. The second will be held at 6pm at the Whakatāne War Memorial Hall. Waikato District Council reminded motorists not to drive on closed roads, after some people ignored the signs and became trapped in floodwaters in their cars. The council said in a release today many roads in Waikato would remain closed this weekend, and would be reassessed on Monday after water levels receded. Farmers were warned to be careful where they put their stock, as some riverside areas may still flood, and the council also asked boaties to steer clear of power lines crossing local rivers, particularly on the Waipa River. Council spokesperson Adam Munro said although the heavy rain had stopped, excess water could still break the banks of some rivers in Piako. He said water breaching the stopbanks and flowing into paddocks was expected, and is part of the flood-system design in Waikato. Mr Munro said the council was monitoring the water levels closely, and any landowners concerned about flooding should get in touch. The council said evacuated residents around Bay of Plenty could have to wait another three days before they would be allowed to return home. Meanwhile a boil-water notice remains in place for the Ruatoki and the Rangitāiki Plain areas. The council said residents in Te Teko, Awakeri and Braemar needed to bring water to a rapid boil for at least one minute before it is safe to drink. The notice would also include Edgecumbe after residents returned. Whakatāne District Council civil defence controller Paula Chapman said caring for flood-affected evacuees and fixing infrastructure would be the priority in Bay of Plenty this weekend. She said they would also keep isolated communities informed and try to clear affected roads. Ms Chapman said specialist crews would determine what needs doing to fix infrastructure and facilities as the water starts to recede. \"Infrastructure-wise, before people can go into areas that perhaps the houses haven't really been affected but they won't necessarily have services so they won't necessarily have water and sewerage and what not. \"So we will be trying really hard to reestablish those services back in.\" She said the best-case scenario was that some pumps would start working today and some people may be able to return home. Whakatāne mayor Tony Bonne said yesterday that people were still isolated in Minginui, Ruatahuna, Te Whaiti and Ruatoki. He said they were trying to figure out exactly how many people were cut off and emergency supplies were being delivered by air. More properties across 500 hectares in the Bay of Plenty could be evacuated as flood waters moved to lower ground. Council flood manager Roger Waugh said properties to the north-west of Edgecumbe, towards the Awaiti Canal and up near Thornton and Matata Roads, were most at risk. \"The floodwaters are migrating down to the lower areas and down into the lower canals. There are issues as it goes through there, there's likely to be maybe some other evacuations, there'll be other property affected and of course obviously it's a farming community, so there's obviously stock and the dairy operation that's being affected.\" Mr Waugh said the water may not reach those areas, but residents should stay on high alert.","The Rangitāiki River has burst its banks, forcing the evacuation of almost the entire town of Edgecumbe. Here is what you need to know. Heavy rains have been inundating many parts of the North Island this week, causing landslips, closing roads and dozens of schools, and forcing evacuations from flood-prone areas.

Heavy rain warnings remain in force in Northland, Coromandel Peninsula, Bay of Plenty, Auckland and northwest Nelson. NIWA said nearly 50mm of rain fell in central Auckland between 5pm and 8pm this evening. It said 27.6mm of rain fell between 5pm and 6pm, making it a tie with the wettest hour in March since records began in 1965. North of Auckland in Mahurangi, more than 51.5mm has fallen, and Kerikeri and Miranda have received more than 35mm in the same period. Auckland Civil Defence planning and intelligence manager Hamish Keith said 100mm more rain was expected overnight. But he said no one had been evacuated from their homes and no roads were blocked in the city. \"What we are encourging people to do is avoid travel if possible. If they do have to travel they should drive to the conditions and they should never drive through floodwaters.\" There have been two landslides near houses on Waiheke Island, with this video, posted on Facebook by Adam Bennett, apparently showing a large slip with a house close to its edge. More than 600 homes are without power in west Auckland. Vector said the 616 homes affected in Titirangi should have their power restored by midnight. And in Silverdale, 108 houses are without power, which is expected to come back on at 11pm. MetService forecaster Lisa Murray said surface flooding from earlier downpours remained in some areas. The Fire Service has had about 30 callouts relating to flooding since 6pm this evening, mainly centred in east Auckland. Northern fire shift manager Megan Ruru said fire staff had been trying to divert water from going into people's basements and homes. There had been call-outs in Howick, Beachlands, Waiheke Island and two in the Coromandel, she said. Rain has also hit Whangamata, with gutters swelling with water and spilling onto footpaths. Earlier today a family was trapped by flooding in their Far North house. Far North Civil Defence coordinator Bill Hutchinson said the water has receded and the family in Waiomio, 35km south of Kerikeri, have been able to leave. He said about 20 people have voluntarily left their homes and were staying at the local Mohinui Marae. He said there was still flooding on State Highways 1, 10 and 11, south of Kerikeri but it was likely to be tidal. It has been the wettest week in nearly three years in Northland, and authorities have warned it is not over yet. Northland Regional Council hydrologist Jason Donaghy said the Waitangi catchment has had 210mm of rain since Tuesday, closely followed by Kaeo with 208mm. The Far North has had 183mm, Whangarei 100mm and Hokianga has had nearly 100mm - bringing an end to months of water restrictions. The heaviest downpour was in Waitangi, with 69mm falling in just one hour. \"We haven't seen rain like that since the floods of July 2014 ,\" Mr Donaghy said. \"But the rain hasn't caused the same problems this time because rivers were low after months of drought.\"","Māori Development Minister Te Ururoa Flavell will talk to ministers about improving communications between marae and agencies during natural disasters, he says. Mr Flavell visited Kaikōura yesterday, almost a fortnight after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake which rocked the region. The town's Takahanga Marae became a makeshift welfare centre after the quake and served about 10,000 meals. Mr Flavell said people flooded to the marae, and many people had worked around the clock looking after visitors. He said he had nothing but admiration for the work people at the marae did in difficult circumstances. \"There was nothing else available at the time so everybody headed to the marae. \"I think we've got some huge gaps to close with respect in communication between agencies and places like marae in these sorts of situations. \"I'll certainly be taking up some of the issues they identified to me about the breakdown in communications with other agencies with the appropriate ministers.\" \"What was clearly pointed out to me is a breakdown in the communication between the marae and the support agencies, right through to Red Cross which is a bit of a surprise. \"What's been highlighted to me is the need for us to look at far better communication with marae because they are a natural place for people to go and agencies who look after people as they come through.\" Te Ururoa Flavell, who used to be a teacher in Kaikōura, said he was surprised at the way the coastline after the quake had changed, especially around the seal colony. \"I can't comprehend what the local community went through, not just during the earthquake, but in the hours and days afterwards. \"We really hope that the Kaikoura community can come through this because some of the industries, the fishing, the tourism are sure going to take a big hit.\"","","More than 400 people have been airlifted out of quake-hit Kaikoura but there is mounting frustration among the hundreds still waiting. The small town, on the east coast of the South Island, was cut off by road by yesterday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake near Hanmer Springs. Military helicopters, private choppers and charter planes have been used in the evacuation. The American warship arriving in New Zealand for an historic visit will head straight to Kaikoura. The USS Sampson was going to be in Auckland tomorrow but an Embassy spokesperson says a decision was made to head to the South Island instead. The US earlier this week offered the ship's two helicopters to help evacuate hundreds of tourists from the town. Kaikoura has had all road access cut off by massive landslips. The New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) expects to have airlifted almost 200 people from Kaikoura to Christchurch by last light today. The elderly, young and pregnant women were prioritised for the free military flights out. Among those rescued so far were 11 campers, including two babies, from Kaikoura's Goose Bay Campground. Wing Commander Scott McKenzie said four Air Force NH90 helicopters had been bringing in food, water, diesel and other basic necessities, as well as rescuing stranded people. The NZDF, the Ministry of Civil Defence and the Red Cross have about 5000kg of aid supplies in Christchurch ready to be delivered to the town. Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee said the inland route to Kaikoura, from the south, would hopefully be cleared and reopened by the weekend. Search and rescue teams were on the ground in Waiau and Kaikoura, and a further 10 police officers had arrived in Kaikoura. Some people complained of a muddled process, with some having to sign up twice to board one of the four military helicopters. It was earlier estimated there were 600 to 700 tourists wanting to leave the town, which had a resident population of more than 2000 people according to the last census. Hayley Menzies, of Melbourne, who waited with her husband, Stewart, and five-month-old, Fletcher, said the process would have been confusing for some people, especially foreign tourists who did not speak much English. \"We found out late last night that we were able to register to be evacuated from here, so we came down and did that. They told us to be here at 8am with all our luggage. \"When we got here, there were 600 other people here. They said that initially there were 400 people that put their names down, and then another 300 this morning, so essentially there were 700 people that wanted to get out today. \"We've been waiting and waiting ... I think it's been quite ordinary, myself - I don't know why someone didn't sit with a laptop and electronically register everybody last night so then they had everyone's details and they could just sort it and prioritise from there. \"Now we've had to list our names all again, and everyone signing up again.\" Leanne Foulds, from Auckland, said she just wanted to leave. \"I think there was a little bit of higgledy-piggledy actually for a while. I don't know if they've got their planning quite right,\" she said. \"But, in saying that, I understand they weren't prepared for anything this big.\" Lieutenant Commander Geoff Andrew said it was simply part of dealing with natural disasters. \"Disorganisation comes with any event on this scale, but certainly the New Zealand Defence Force is operating in assistance with the civil authority here. \"We're not attempting to run or take over the operation. We're very much here to assist the police and the civil defence authorities.\" The evacuees were being taken to Christchurch, where local authorities were helping make arrangements for tourists. Civil Defence commander Sarah Stuart-Black said this afternoon that regional states of emergencies remained in place in Kaikoura and Hurunui. The agency was ensuring people affected by the earthquakes were safe and being cared for, she said. Hundreds of NZDF personnel, at least eight aircraft and two ships were assisting the government's response. Joint Forces Commodore Darryn Webb said the priority was evacuating the tourists and residents who had been displaced and who were being accommodated at a local marae and various community buildings. The Chinese consulate had also been chartering helicopters to help evacuate its citizens. Ms Stuart-Black said getting logistical support into the area was the biggest challenge. \"With no road access right now that's our most challenging issue we're facing. \"Certainly we're getting great support from the Defence Force in providing aerial support, and the fact that the Canterbury is on its way to help with those logistical challenges.\" Minister of Health Jonathan Coleman said earlier that 12 patients had been airlifted from Kaikoura to Christchurch since yesterday's earthquakes. They were being treated for injuries including lacerations, a broken hip and a head injury. There was also a pregnant woman who needed additional care. Mr Coleman said the patients' transfers were well coordinated with St John and aero-medical providers. Transport Minister Simon Bridges said it would be a matter of days before road access to Kaikoura was restored. Mr Bridges said the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) was prioritising opening State Highway 70, the inland road to the town. There were several bridges that needed work and it would be days, not months, for that to be done, he said. State Highway 1 was closed between Seddon and Cheviot, but remained open on the rest of the route between Picton and Christchurch. The NZTA said there was an alternative route between Picton and Christchurch over Lewis Pass, which would take about 7.5 hours. It said even on that route some sections were reduced to one lane. State Highway 7 had been reopened to motorists and freight, and 7A was open between 7am and 7pm. In other parts of the country, extensive flooding has brought parts of both major motorways out of Wellington to a standstill. In Marlborough, State Highway 6 was closed from Rai Valley to Renwick by surface flooding. Vodafone, Spark and Chorus were working together to restore phone services but restoration work could take weeks or even months. They said the fibre optic cable, which runs along State Highway 1 through Clarence and Kaikoura to Christchurch and supports fixed-line and mobile networks, had broken in six places. They were investigating the possibility of using an undersea cable along the coast to temporarily connect the township.","Extensive flooding and slips have caused chaos around wider Wellington, although conditions and traffic restrictions are now easing. The capital city and wider region were rocked by Monday's 7.5 earthquake, which struck near Hanmer Springs, and today faced stormy weather. Slips and flooding at one point closed both northbound routes out of the city. Three people were evacuated from an area near the Waiwhetu Stream in Lower Hutt as a result of flooding, but have been cleared to return. Two houses in Paremata in Porirua and one house in Pukerua Bay were evacuated because of slips. One northbound lane on State Highway 1 between Wellington and the Kapiti Coast had reopened, and all lanes on SH2 were now open. The New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) was working to open a southbound lane between Pukerua Bay and Plimmerton, however SH58 - the Haywards Hill Road - would remain closed overnight. Buses had resumed to the Hutt Valley. The only train service that was still suspended was between Porirua and Waikanae. Keneperu Station on the Kapiti Line was closed, as was Pomare Station on the Hutt Valley Line. About 500 homes in Pukerua Bay and the Porirua suburb of Camborne were still without power. A Wellington Electricity spokesperson said the Pukerua Bay outage was due to a flood-related slip, and it was not known what caused the others. People wanting to travel north were earlier told to stay put until at least 8pm, and parents were advised to make alternative arrangements for picking up their children after school. Porirua Mayor Mike Tana said people have been evacuated from two houses on Paremata Crescent in Porirua and one in Pukerua Bay because of slips. People could go to the Porirua Club and the Horouta Marae should they want to leave their homes, he said. RNZ producer Melanie Phipps said early this afternoon that motorists travelling from the Kapiti Coast into Wellington City were risking a five-hour journey. Ms Phipps was stuck at Mackays Crossing near Paekakariki, 48km north of Wellington. \"People have abandoned their cars on the side of the road here and have gone on foot through Queen Elizabeth Park. She said at the time that motorists could either wait out the closure, or turn their cars around and drive for four to five hours through the Manawatu Gorge back to the city. The flooding also closed schools and disrupted NCEA exams in the region. Aotea College principal Kate Gainsford said some students were gridlocked in traffic and missed their exams, and the school hosted some students from other schools. Slips were expected to prevent some staff from getting home and the college was preparing to host them overnight, she said. Wellington's Regional Emergency Management Office, however, said the rainfall was easing. Wet conditions were also making life more difficult in Marlborough, which was badly hit by Monday's quake. The highway between Blenheim and Nelson closed due to flooding in Canvastown. Emergency services reported earlier that the Pelorus River had breached its banks and evacuations were planned in the area. A cordon was placed on SH6 at the Wairau Bridge and traffic heading to Nelson was being diverted through SH63 through the Wairau Valley to St Arnaud. The area was also at the mercy of severe northwest gales, gusting at up to 130km/h. A couple and their four young children had to been rescued by helicopter after heavy rain made it impossible for them to leave their home. Marlborough Civil Defence said so much water was pouring down the hillside behind their house in the Waikakaho Valley, bringing with it logs and debris, they were unable to safely leave. The agency had also issued a warning about sewerage overflows due to a power cut caused by the earthquake. Kaikoura, which has been cut off from the rest of the country by major landslides, was likely to have clear weather later today, MetService said. Steady rain also triggered flood alerts in Otago. Pomahaka River in South Otago triggered two flood warnings this morning, though seems to have peaked. The Otago Regional Council said rivers had also risen in North Otago. It said heavy rain was forecast for tomorrow and Thursday, and would fall on sodden ground, so there was a risk of flooding later in the week.","There have been two fatalities after a series of huge earthquakes overnight, Prime Minister John Key says. Authorities were scrambling this morning to assess damage and respond to reports of injuries after the first 7.5 magnitude earthquake centred near Hanmer Springs. Watch: Prime Minister John Key media conference The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management confirmed there had been two deaths from the earthquake. One person died in a house that collapsed in Kaikoura, and a second person died at a house in Mt Lyford, north of Christchurch. Mr Key said a Defence Force helicopter would be flying to Kaikoura and another one would be available in Wellington. An Urban Search and Rescue team from Christchurch was also on its way to Kaikoura by helicopter, along with two further assessment teams deployed to Waiau and Blenheim. As a result of the quake, Mr Key cancelled his proposed trade trip to Argentina, and will decide later this week whether to attend APEC in Peru next weekend. Nelson Marlborough District Health Board said five people had been admitted to Wairau Hospital by early this morning with various injuries, some described as moderate. Earthquake: What you need to know LIVE: Earthquake updates as they happen Scores of aftershocks rattle country Kaikoura cut off by road Earthquake: In pictures The first quake struck at 12.02am, near Hanmer Springs, at a depth of 16km. It was followed by a series of large earthquakes across New Zealand up to 6.2 in magnitude, which prompted tsunami alerts, causing residents of coastal areas to flee inland. GNS science said there had been at least 250 aftershocks since the massive shake just after midnight, with more than 30 of them above magnitude 5, and three of magnitude 6 and above. Most were in the upper South Island, in Seddon and Kaikoura, but a 4.9 magnitude earthquake hit Paraparaumu and a 4.9 hit Wellington in the early hours. The Civil Defence ministry said roads were closed on State Highway 1 between Blenheim and Picton, State Highway 6 between between Blenheim and Nelson, and State Highway 7 between Springs Junction and Waipara. It warned people to check for any dangers on damaged properties including to gas and water supplies. The earthquake sequence is the biggest since the 5.7 Valentine's Day earthquake, which caused cliffs in the Christchurch suburb of Sumner to fall and liquefaction in some east Christchurch areas. Tsunami activity was detected in Kaikoura and Wellington, with initial tsunami warnings prompting sirens from Northland to Christchurch, and waves detected in Wellington and the South Island. A tsunami at least 2m high was recorded near Kaikoura, Civil Defence tweeted. The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management has now cancelled the tsunami warning that was in place from Wellington to Banks Peninsula. But it said coasts may still experience unusual, strong currents and sea level fluctuations lasting for several more hours. KiwiRail said all trains on the North Island Main Trunk line, south of Palmerston North, and in the South Island had been cancelled until further notice. Ferry sailings were also cancelled until a full assessment could be made of the terminals in Wellington and Picton. The Ministry of Education advised schools and early childhood centres from North Canterbury through to Wellington would remain closed today. It also said all NCEA Scholarship exams would be suspended. Houses were reported to be damaged in Kaikoura, with chimneys down in Culverden. Police earlier said they were trying to get access to the Mt Lyford property where one person was thought to have died. Three evacuation centres were open in Christchurch. At 5am there were 230 people at Linwood College, 50 at Mairehau School and 25 at Akaroa School Hall. Hotel guests in central Christchurch were evacuated. More than 100 people stood on the footpath opposite the Christchurch Casino, while at least 100 hotel guests were outside the Novotel, opposite the Christ Church Cathedral. Alan Vincent was on the water near Lyttelton near Christchurch when the quake struck. He said it felt like \"giants shaking the living daylights out of the boat\". Cheviot firefighter Chris Hill said the roads were \"a bit cut up\". A temporary boil water notice has been issued in Hurunui. A welfare centre was set up at the Amberley Pavilion. Christchurch police have set up roadblocks to stop people going to coastal areas while a tsunami warning was in place. Robin, from Christchurch, said the earthquake was a \"wake-up call\". New Brighton resident Dean Kozanic evacuated his home as a precaution because of the tsunami warning. He said many residents in the suburb had been doing the same. Power was cut in North Canterbury, from Kaikoura to Cheviot. The Hurunui District Council said Rotherham and Waiau were isolated by slips and damage to the bridge. Marlborough Civil Defence controller Richard McNamara said a train had been trapped north of Kaikoura this morning. \"Our helicopter will drop in and check on the driver, we've been talking to train control South Island,\" Mr McNamara said early this morning. \"There'll be other people on the road that will be stuck and obviously the heavy traffic between Picton [at] the interisland ferry and Christchurch will also be held up.\" He said bridges north of Blenheim had been damaged, but there was a diversion in place. Fiona Redfern, of Muzzle Station on the Clarence River, warned neighbours on Facebook that the Dart Stream tributary had become dammed due to a slip and a flash flood could come at any time. Several people spent hours stuck on the Interislander Ferry, which was unable to dock in Picton due to a power cut. Other ferry movements were suspended for the day. Marlborough Civil Defence said buildings in Picton's main street were reported to be badly damaged, and the earthquake had caused liquefaction on the Picton foreshore. Twenty people were receiving welfare help in the Ward Town Hall in Marlborough. The area from Seddon to Ward had been checked by helicopters and some damage to electrical transmission poles had been found which could take days to repair. There was a diversion in place on SH1 between Picton and Blenheim, which was open for some vehicles but heavier vehicles could not get through and were reported to be banked up for several kilometres along the highway. Picton residents were asked to conserve water as one of the town's reservoirs was leaking. An evacuation centre was being opened at the Waikawa Marae. The Nelson Marlborough District Health Board said by early this morning five people had been admitted to Wairau Hospital with various injuries, some described as moderate. Spark said its phone networks in Clarence, Kaikoura, Weld Cone, Waiau and Eltham in the South Island have been affected. People should text rather than call if possible, it said. Power went out in many areas including Picton, Blenheim and Havelock. Lansdowne Park in Blenheim was also closed due to liquefaction. Wellington City Council warned people not to go to work in the central city and Lower Hutt until the evening. Several multi-story buildings received damage - both internally and structurally - and glass fell into streets. Power was out in some areas, and Civil Defence controller Bruce Pepperell said early indications were that a number of major buildings showed signs of structural stress and the strong quake would likely have caused a mess inside. Mr Pepperell said the capital's suburban rail network would not be operating until further notice, while rail tracks, bridges and tunnels were checked. Buses were unlikely to replace the trains. He said 25 buildings in the CBD had so far been identified as having suffered potential structural damage. \"Certainly there's indications of some structural stress down in some of the buildings down in the CentrePort. \"There's a little bit of liquefaction down there, well, a lot of the CBD's on reclaimed land.\" The damage had been referred to building owners for detailed examination by engineers, Mr Pepperell said. Some city streets were showered with broken glass during the quake and it was feared strong winds tonight could dislodge more glass. Land movement of up to 1m has been reported on reclaimed land on the waterfront with large cracks opening up in concreted areas. Wellington Harbour Master Mike Pryce said he and port operator CentrePort were still assessing the earthquake damage to the waterfront including liquefaction. CentrePort said it would issue an update on the situation shortly. Victoria and Massey university campuses in the capital were closed this morning, with Massey saying exams would be postponed until further notice. People who left their homes in the city centre were told they could find temporary refuge at the BizDojo Centre on 115 Tory Street, or Houghton Valley School further out of the city. Residents in coastal areas were urged to stay inland or on high ground. Affected spots include seaside areas of Wellington's south coast, Seatoun and Eastbourne. The state of emergency in Dunedin has been lifted after Civil Defence evacuated about 50 households in seaside communities. Civil Defence in Otago said the land-based threat to the eastern coasts had passed and people were being allowed to go home. The controller for Clutha district, Charles Hakkaart, said the main evacuations were in low-lying houses in Pounawea, Taieri Mouth and Toko Mouth. About 40 people were evacuated from their homes on the Chatham Islands, mainly in the settlement of Kaingaroa, and more made their own way to higher ground. Chatham Islands mayor Alfred Priest said the island was the path for tsunamis from both New Zealand and South America, and locals were good at responding to the threats.","What is the emergency? The national news agenda has been dominated for a month now by the plight of homeless people in New Zealand, and Auckland especially. So this is a new thing? While the problem is getting worse, pretty much everyone agrees it is not new. The issue surged into the media and political spotlight, however, following a report for TV3's The Nation on May 14, in which Mike Wesley-Smith met people living in garages and cars in south Auckland. A stream of powerful stories have followed. Is \"emergency\" not overstating it then? Look, we were trying to find a less politically problematic word than \"crisis\". Where to find these powerful stories, then? The Toby &amp; Toby journalistic appreciation subcommittee has been impressed by coverage across the board, not least the work from emerging RNZ talent John Campbell and his colleagues at Checkpoint. An interview last week with TA, an 11-year-old girl who had been living with her family of eight in a van before being taken in by Te Puea Marae in Mangere Bridge, seemed to touch people especially. Here it is, illustrated: What do the numbers say about homelessness in NZ? The best we can do is a University of Otago study based on census data which found that 41,705 people, or one in every 100 New Zealanders, was homeless as of 2013 (the last census), compared with one in 120 in 2006, and one in 130 in 2001. Is that what they mean by the one-percenters? No. And what does \"homeless\" mean in this context? According to the official definition, as established by Statistics NZ in 2009, \"homelessness\" means \"having no other options to acquire safe and secure housing\", encompassing four categories: sleeping with no shelter or makeshift shelter, including on the street or in cars; in temporary shelter such as hostels, camp sites or refuges; sharing temporary accommodation in someone else's private dwelling; and \"uninhabitable housing\". What is the root cause of the crisis? We're calling it an emergency. Emergency kind of sounds worse than crisis. Can we move on? Sure. What is the root cause of the homelessness problem? The core of the problem, as summarised in a 2014 parliamentary library study, is \"the provision of affordable accommodation\". The impact of an over-heated and under-supplied Auckland housing market is being felt across the city and beyond, but the pinch is in the tail, with a severe shortage of social housing. Is that the same as state housing? The government prefers social housing, a catch-all to include Housing New Zealand dwellings and those provided by community groups such as the Salvation Army and iwi. Indeed, one of the marquee government housing policies is the transfer of state stock to community groups. Does \"transfer\" mean \"sale\"? Yes. How's that gone? Oh, you know, mixed. What is the government doing about the homeless problem? The government, which has three cabinet ministers assigned to different strands of housing, says it is making progress with freeing up land and advancing building projects in Auckland, that it has poured millions into emergency housing, that cash incentives are being offered to those seeking social housing to move out of Auckland and that it may block-book motel rooms for the winter months. People with nowhere else to go who are forced to stay in motels will no longer have to pay for the first seven nights. Pay for them? Isn't that the how could the point that they? Spit it out. What's the question? How could people who can't afford the cheapest rentals pay for motel rooms? The system has been that the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) pays for the rooms, with the tenant expected to reimburse MSD over time. Some families have reportedly chalked up debts of as much as $70,000. Isn't part of the problem that many of these people don't want help? There is no doubt that some are reluctant to engage with government departments, but this is a small minority. It's just that, a couple of weeks ago an MSD \"flying squad\" went out with the Salvation Army in Takanini and knocked on eight cars and all eight refused support. The prime minister did say that happened, but the Salvation Army issued a statement saying no, it didn't. Turned out it was the result of a \"miscommunication\". Which part wasn't true? That there was a \"flying squad\"? That MSD were out there with the Sallies? That they knocked on cars? Or that the occupants refused support? Yes. What does the research say about the impacts of homelessness? It's unambiguous - there is widespread evidence in New Zealand and overseas of considerable and lasting detriment to physical and mental health, education, employment prospects, and so on, with children (who make up half of NZ's homeless number) most vulnerable of all. Or, to look at it another way, the NZ Human Rights Commission says \"Prioritising the right to healthy, affordable housing has a demonstrably positive impact on health, educational development, and social and psychological wellbeing\". Is housing a right? The right to adequate housing is recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And where does Te Puea come into it? The marae, in Māngere Bridge, has opened its doors (as have other marae) to dozens of homeless people in recent weeks. It has become a lightning rod politically, most recently with Paula Bennett denying claims her office has been smearing the marae chairman. But it has been a lightning rod, too, for community compassion and solidarity, with donations, gifts and volunteers flooding in. That's very generous. But don't we already have a system where society provides shelter and housing to the most vulnerable, with a kind of formula that means the best-off contribute the most? Take your crazy radical thinking and get out of here. * This column is part of a weekly series published every Wednesday, by graphic artist Toby Morris and journalist Toby Manhire.","Locals of the upper reaches of the Whanganui River are delighted a new bridge is opening that will clear the road into Whanganui in time for Christmas. Access to the city has been blocked at Pipiriki since June, when major slips were caused by severe flooding. Ruapehu District Council mayor Don Cameron said Pipiriki residents even had to tough it out through slips to make the trip north to Raetihi. \"Some of them parked their 4WD motorbikes by the first slip, hopped on it, went across, picked their car up on the other side and went to Raetihi to get their groceries\" he said. The flooding in June was the worst the region had ever seen and isolated many pockets of the Whanganui River Road community. The Upokonui bridge replaces a large washed out culvert. Raetihi resident Rangi Bristol travels the road regularly and said it has been a nuisance but that people expected it from those back roads. \"I am sure it is going to improve it 100 percent getting access without any problems.\" Josephine Haworth and her husband Ken run Whanganui River Adventures in Pipiriki, which has been hurt by the lack of access. \"We have had to actually send our people all the way around SH4 and it's an extra half an hour on top of their time,\" she said. \"At this time of year we are usually flat out with campervans coming to stay in our camp ground but they haven't been able to because they are all driving down SH4 now.\" The Haworths were positive that the new bridge will solve the problem. \"We are both pretty rapt that it is finally going to be finished and we can get on with our tourism for the summer,\" she said. Mr Cameron said more and more tourists were travelling the river road. \"Nearly 4000 cyclist alone are going through there. On top of that you have got hikers doing the Te Ara Roa trail from Cape to Bluff and also campervans and general tourists.\" A ceremony will be held at Paraweka Marae in Pipiriki today and a ribbon will be cut to officially open Upokonui bridge.","Many kohanga reo in Whanganui have opened their doors to others who have been unable to reach their own buildings along the river road. The city and district had record high floods in June, which caused slips and washed away parts of the rural Whanganui River Road. A number of kohanga reo, located at marae along the river, have been unable to reach their own facilities, and so have shared buildings with kohanga in the city. Aotea Kohanga District manager Ruka Broughton said it had been a true display of whakawhanaungatanga (nurturing relationships). He said each kohanga whānau needed to be acknowledged for linking to the principles that make them who they are as a people and as a kohanga reo. Mr Broughton said the leadership came from within, and all tamariki were safe. Some kohanga reo are only now able to return to their buildings up the river road.","The demand for repairs for marae nationwide is growing as many hit the century-old mark. But there are fears the loss of knowledge of traditional Maori art work means some marae are missing out on their own tribal touch. The Maori built heritage advisor for Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Jim Schuster visits marae nationwide to help restore tukutuku - the woven panels that cover the interior walls of the marae. He has been doing the job since 2003 and his services are in high demand. \"The marae that were built around those early years are now getting to 80-100 years old. \"A lot of it is just wear and tear but it's the kowhaiwhai and whakairo on the outside of the wharenui that take the brunt of the weather. But on the inside it's the tukutuku panels that takes it. \"Just people rubbing up against them, and haututu kids picking at them, probably.\" Mr Schuster, of Te Arawa, learned his technique from his mother, who was taught by her parents. He said this intergenerational knowledge could not be learned at university and he was worried it was disappearing fast. \"I have to tell the people, I say 'look, this is how I was taught, this is matauranga I've learned, so it's naturally going to be a Te Arawa version of this matauranga'. \"I usually ask them are there any old people around that still know about tukutuku or know about where the kiekie (weaving plant) is, but not a lot of them do - it's just knowledge that's gone.\" A big part of Mr Schuster's work involves harvesting traditional plants such as toitoi and kiekie to fix the tukutuku panels. He said that was difficult as a lot of native bush had been taken over by pine trees and invasive plants. Ngati Kahungunu Iwi Incorporated chair Ngahiwi Tomoana said through its Treaty Settlement, the Hawke's Bay iwi was planting kiekie to combat this. But he said some marae had to improvise in the meantime. \"One of the most recent marae built in Kahungunu is Pukemokimoki at Maraenui in Napier. They've used all the tukutuku methods but they've used plastic and blings and everything else that look the same but in a modern context. So that's what we have to cope with.\" Mr Tomoana said Kahuranaki Marae recently celebrated its 100th birthday, and kiekie was used instead of flax for some of its repairs. Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Maori heritage manager Dean Whiting said restoration work included using glass and paint to protect surfaces and applying chemicals to stop decay. But Mr Whiting said it was not just natural wear and which threatened marae. \"Our wharenui and places like that are quite vulnerable to catastrophic events like fire and in some cases flooding. But really, fire is probably one of the greatest risks we have, especially for our taonga whare. \"We are often promoting the message about really considering sprinkler systems as a way to protect buildings so that's probably a key one.\" Mr Whiting said not many whanau lived on the pa anymore, which made it hard to keep an eye on marae. And said says sprinkler systems were also expensive to install.","New Zealand's resthomes, schools, marae and rugby clubs today gave their men in black an extra push to take on the world. The All Blacks went to the nation for their last public appearances in the provinces before the Rugby World Cup. The 31-man squad was dispatched for the day to 10 towns and cities, from Long Bay in Auckland to Mataura in Southland, as they prepare to leave for Britain next Thursday. Kieran Reid and the two Bens - Smith and Franks - were in South Dunedin, visiting two schools and a rest-home. Three months ago to the day the Radius Fulton resthome in South Dunedin was knee-deep in water, one of the worst-hit places in the city's floods. Today, the residents celebrated their return with visit of some of their heroes. Lloyd Martin who played rugby in the 1940s and is nearly blind, says the visit was the ultimate. \"I was really pleased to meet our number 8. And although I cannot see, I can see bulk and he is the bulkiest number 8 I have ever met, he's a big boy, Kieran Reid.\" The trio enthusiastically chatted and posed for photos and signed things for the residents, their excited grandchilden and many of the staff for almost an hour. Karen Lobb, whose father lives at the home, said there could not have been a better celebration. \"I think after the floods, they've been through a very hard time. It's been very disruptive.\", she says. \"A lot of people have had to move out. And to bring everyone back together for a special thing like today, it's just brilliant.\" Lunch was healthy chicken and salad wraps at Bayfield High School, which the players had to join in cooking. Students Julia Gwynne Jones and Jade Fielding cooked chicken with Ben Smith. \"Being able to have normal conversations with them and hear about their lives, it's great,\" Jade said. \"These are people I've grown up watching and respecting, and it's just incredible they take the time to come and show us all this,\" Julia said. The trio's last visit was to Tahuna Intermediate's turn. They turned out for a full assembly, giving the men a thunderous welcome and loud haka before asking a range of searching questions including how they deal with sponsorship and if they really eat Weetbix as advertised. Reid said it was a chance to meet meet a different fan demographic. \"We actually get something out of it ourselves, it does give you a bit of motivation and an extra something before we fly over there,\" he said.","","","","The Government says it will help local councils with the cost of the floods in Whanganui, estimated to be about $120 million. The Manawatu-Whanganui Regional Council said that figure included social, building and economic costs to business but excluded the rural sector. Council recovery manager Greg Shirley said the estimate was likely to be refined as further information came to light. Prime Minister John Key, who was in Whanganui this afternoon, said the impact of the floods would be too great for councils to withstand on their own. He said, historically, the government had contributed 60 percent of costs, with insurance footing some of the bill. \"It's difficult for us to know on day one, you know, just how much of it in theory we're on the hook for as the government, just as a starting point plus insurance,\" he said. \"But I find it very difficult to believe we wouldn't need to top that up with some more support.\" Mr Key said it was still early days, and the Government would need to look at how much it would contribute and how that would work. He said he would talk to the Minister of Finance and other Cabinet colleagues on Monday about help for Whanganui and Taranaki. A state of emergency is likely to stay in place in Whanganui for at least another week. Emergency cordons are being removed around the city; the Taupo Quay cordon in the central business area was lifted this morning and it was expected part of Anzac Parade in East Whanganui will open this afternoon. The remaining cordons should be lifted tomorrow. Civil defence controller Jonathan Barrett said the focus was turning to emotional support for people seeing their damaged homes for the first time. A psychological support group has been set up at a Red Cross command post on Anzac Parade and district health board counsellors will be available at the Civil Defence Welfare Centre at Whanganui Girls College. Civil defence authorities said they had now contacted the estimated 200 people isolated in outlying parts of the region, including at nine remote marae. Cedric Eruera Nepia, of Te Ati Haunui Apaparangi, has been been on helicopter flights to check on people's welfare. He said the emergency relief helicopters had been dropping off food supplies, generators and medical supplies, and transporting some people back to town. About 75 per cent of the roads in flood-affected parts of the district have now reopened, but dozens of rurals roads and State Highway 4 remain closed. Civil Defence said many slips were considered too unstable and dangerous to work on, and repairs have been suspended because of rain expected this weekend. The current estimate for roading repairs just in Whanganui alone stands at $40 million.","While the Whanganui River floodwaters are receding, residents in the remote river valley are still feeling vulnerable, with emergency services unable to reach them by road. The small Māori settlement of Pipiriki is one of those places still marooned after massive slips washed out the road to Raetihi and also the River Road that connects it to the city of Whanganui, 87 kilometres away. As the city of Whanganui regains a sense of normality after experiencing its biggest flood in recorded history, residents further up the river are still cut off and isolated. Pipiriki, about two hours drive north of the city, is severed off from all essential services - the only way in is by helicopter. A kaumatua who lives in Pipiriki, Bobby Gray, said although most people had plenty of provisions and were safe, they were still in a precarious situation if anyone needed an ambulance. \"Illness and getting hurt having accidents are our main concern because if any of those things fail then we are a long way from rescue. \"There are some places not even helicopters can't get there to help us unless they dangle ropes down and things like that,\" Mr Gray said. He said because the flood was still leaving behind huge amounts of debris and silt, not even jetboats or canoes could reach Pipiriki. \"All our landing places are covered in sloshy, quite dangerous mud, you couldn't walk on it, you'd disappear as if it was quicksand or something like that. \"We've got a family of ours a bit further up the river who have got a jetboat, but they've only got enough petrol to get to Pipiriki, but they can't come to Pipiriki because there is no landing place.\" Ruapehu District Council spokesperson Margaret Hawthorne said engineers had been making aerial assessments of the Raetihi to Pipiriki Road. She said it could be closed for weeks - except to four wheel drive vehicles. \"There's two major slips where the road has completely disappeared,\" Ms Hawthorne said. \"Looking at the situation they [the road engineers] expect to be able to get four wheel drive and machine digger access down into the gully below the slip and then back up the other side onto the remaining road. \"So, we're hoping that in about a week at least there'll be four wheel drive access.\" Further down the river from Pipiriki, 10 minutes drive north of Whanganui city, is Upokongaro School on State Highway Four. Tamariki Māori make up more than 90 percent of the school's roll and it's only just reopened today. But its principal Warren Brown said tamariki from Kaiwhaiki Marae, up-river from the kura, would not be able to return until tomorrow. \"With the road leading from State Highway 4 up to Kaiwhaiki Marae there's some low sections in that roadway, and of course with the massive amount of water that we've had down in the last few days that's all silted up,\" Mr Brown said. \"There's about 20 kids that come down from the pā, but it also affects the kids from around Lismore Forest area as well.\" Mr Gray said on a spiritual level the flooding of the awa was a reminder of its power and mana, and that even when it was tranquil, it still demanded a high level of respect.","Pūtiki Marae in Whanganui has been badly hit by the flooding that has inundated parts of the city - and other parts of the North Island - over the last few days. A stream of floodwater has been running through the meeting house, Te Paku o Te Rangi. The marae lies very close to the river, not far from the Cobham Bridge on State Highway Three. Adrian Te Patu, who is from the marae, said it was thought to be only the second time it had flooded in its 200-plus year history. \"The meeting house is a very unusual one. It is a traditional marae meeting house, where you step down into it, and so the water has got in,\" he said. \"We saw some of the photos that came up and were posted on Facebook, which showed some of the mattresses floating in there the other night, so we are all very sad. It is a very beautiful meeting house.\" The four marae administered by Ngāti Apa fared better than Pūtiki, including Kauangaroa Marae, which suffered badly in the 2004 floods. This time, the grounds were flooded but the buildings have remained undamaged. Some families living near the Kauangaroa Marae were evacuated to higher ground while marae along the Whangaehu River also came close to flooding. Mark Pirikahu, who has been co-ordinating Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Apa's response, said some people have almost nothing left. \"Down in Whangaehu, one of our elders and her two grandchildren lost everything, so what they currently wear on themselves is what they owned. Everything else has gone.\" Adrian Rurawhe, the MP for Te Tai Hauauru, has been moving through the rohe assessing the damage, and said the flooding had not only devastated Whanganui but rural areas as well. \"There are slips on hills and then, of course, all of the silt that is brought down by the rivers settles on the land, and so there will be a big effort to put the land right again and get the grass growing again. Yes, it is pretty devastating.\" Mr Rurawhe said a major clean-up would soon begin at the various marae. \"Removing silt from the marae area... There will have to be a decision made if the water has got into the buildings, and the water damage to the floors in particular, and that will have to be assessed and whether or not it will be replaced.\" A local man, Jay Rerekura, lives in Whanganui East and has only just been able to get out of the area this afternoon. \"So there is a little bit of clean-up that is happening at the moment,\" he said. \"Civil Defence is trying to co-ordinate all of that with people who are from the local communities, who have rallied in behind, and they have their shovels and gumboots ready to go. \"Basically, contamination from sewage is the biggest worry, so they are trying to make sure that people are not just going in and getting stuck in to clean up mud, and getting sick as a result.\" Gerrard Albert, a tribal negotiator for the Whanganui River, believed the flooding would teach people an important lesson. \"The river will flood and, when it floods, that is its will, and we need as people to understand our place in the river scheme and be happy with it. \"Not withstanding that, I am aware that people have been disadvantaged greatly by the loss of possessions and in some cases livelihood.\" Enhanced Taskforce Green, which employs local beneficiaries, has been activated by the Government and some of those workers may be available to help clean up marae.","Whanganui locals are coming to grips with the devastation caused by the city's biggest ever floods. People are slowly being let back into their homes as the floodwaters recede and roads reopen. But some said the mess left behind would take years to clean up. Hone Tamehima said seeing a river run through the meeting room at the Putiki Marae was an emotional experience. The heavy rain stopped two days ago but the water was still shin deep, and the problems it caused were not going anywhere. Mr Tamehima said repairing sacred Maori art would not come cheap when the taonga was priceless. \"Insurance-wise, we couldn't even get an evaluation on the carvings, with [them] being original. No insurance company wanted to go near it.\" The carvings were about 200 years old. Over the bridge in Whanganui East were some of the worst hit properties in the region. The playing fields of Kowhai Park were now a temporary pond of brown, muddy water. Graham Broughton, a long-time resident, had lived there for almost all of his 77 years. That meant he was there for the major floods in 2004 and even 1940 - but these were the worst he had seen. \"My dad had a mate who had a dinghy, and I - apparently, I was too young to remember - but I was in the dinghy floating out through the trees in Kowhai Park. \"That was in the 1940 flood, and that was a biggie. So how everything is going to get back to normal...It's going to take a long time.\" Roger Whiting has lived in Whanganui East for more than 30 years. He shifted from Auckland in 1981 to raise his family down here - and said seeing his home in the state it was in now was tough. Mr Whiting agreed recovery would be a long road. \"It's very hard to take it all in. It's quite extensive, the problem, obviously. It's very much a handling the shock situation. \"It's an individual thing, depending on your own circumstances.\" Whanganui mayor Annette Main said the real clean up had not even started, because they were not sure if it was safe to yet. But for many locals, the problems caused by the flood would stick around far longer than the mud.","","","More than 3000 properties in Canterbury are likely to be without power overnight after heavy snow damaged power lines - while rain continues to fall on the West Coast. What's the weather like where you are? Share your pictures or video with us by email iwitness@radionz.co.nz Heavy snow knocked out power lines close to the towns of Fairlie and Geraldine yesterday and, at one point, about 4500 homes were without electricity. Alpine Energy said 1800 of its customers had still not been reconnected. The company has apologised, and said its crews would be out over the weekend. Another 1500 properties near Christchurch also remained cut off. Their lines company, Orion, said those customers were also likely to be without power overnight. Families in Hokitika on the West Coast are still being evacuated after heavy rain caused rising rivers and flooding. Westland District Council chief executive Tanya Winter has been coordinating the town's emergency response. Several flooded homes and a rest home have been evacuated and, with rain still pouring in the town, Ms Winter told Checkpoint the requests for help were ongoing. \"We are going to be evacuating a family from Kaniere, so we are working with the Red Cross and the Fire Service to make that happen,\" she said. \"We have just booked that family into a motel for the weekend.\" Ms Winter said Red Cross teams would return to the town tomorrow to help people get rid of wet furniture and carpets. Several highways in Canterbury, Otago and Southland were closed overnight but nearly all have now re-opened. A number of snow, slip and flooding warnings for drivers remain in place. The stretch of SH6 from Lake Hawea to Makarora is expected to be closed at 10pm tonight to help workers clear a slip, with the highway expected to open again at 7am on Saturday. In the North Island, the Kapiti Coast District Council warned people to stay away from local waterways this afternoon as the storm moved north. Meteorologist Rob Kerr said the storm was moving north with up to 250 millimetres expected in the next 24 hours in the Tararua Ranges and up to 100 millimetres on the Kapiti Coast. More bad weather was expected to hit parts of the North Island over the next 48 hours. Overnight, severe flooding in Hokitika inundated the central business district and forced the evacuation of a rest home and 30 properties. About 400mm of rain fell on the West Coast in the 24 hours to 6am and more rain was expected tonight. West Coast Civil Defence regional manager Chris Raine said the rest home was threatened by floodwaters late last night and 46 residents had to be moved out. Some were taken to another rest home while others were taken to Greymouth Hospital, he said. Hokitika Primary School was closed but all other schools in the flood-affected area were thought to have stayed open. The school said most of its teachers lived in Greymouth and the main road between the two centres was restricted to four-wheel-drive vehicles. A couple and their dog had to be rescued by inflatable boat and helicopter early this morning from their home near Kumara after flood water left them stranded. Another household on the West Coast - the Dempsters - was woken by neighbours and told to evacuate and go to a nearby marae. Belinda Dempster said her house was like a castle with a moat. She said that, as the family left, water was pouring down the hillsides and the road out was severely damaged. She said the family - including her husband and four children - and neighbours had to jump a half-metre gap where a culvert had collapsed, and taken the road with it. \"We went to the lowest point and they said 'be careful, we might put a plank across' but then they said 'let's just get everybody out', because at that stage we didn't know what was gonna happen.\" Ms Dempster said there was no damage to the family's house when they returned at about 7am. Hokitika resident Max Dowell said this morning that his garage had been flooded. He said his personal rain gauge recorded that 241mm of rain had fallen on his home in the past 24 hours. MetService meteorologist Rebekah LaBar said the snow level in Canterbury and Otago would \"gradually rise today\" from about 200 metres to 500 metres. \"The worst is over but I hate to say that it's going to be improving a whole lot ... It's still going to be a pretty rainy, showery time.\" She said snow got down to lower levels than expected yesterday, with the Canterbury towns of Ashburton and Timaru both receiving snow showers. Ms LaBar said rain and snow would continue today for parts of Canterbury and Otago but the cold front would slowly move north. Waikato, Northland and the Bay of Plenty were expected to catch the storm tomorrow as it moved northward. Parts of Taranaki and the Central Plateau were also expected to receive more rain today and into tomorrow with snow likely for the Desert Road.","","A Lower Hutt marae is calling for more support from its local council after the building was flooded during last week's devastating storm. Māori spent the day bailing rainwater out of Kōkiri Marae in Seaview and using pillows and mattresses as sandbags to try and soak up the water. The general manager of Kōkiri Marae said water poured into the building, but it was not the first time that had happened. Tina Olsen-Ratana said it had asked the Hutt City Council for a number of years to sort out the drains on the road outside the marae which get blocked during heavy rain. Ms Olsen-Ratana said people at the marae tried to push the water rushing into the building back onto the road, but there was nowhere for it to go and it poured back in. \"Over the years we have had many discussions with council over the issue. The last one I was part of was [when] they sent an engineer down who advised that we have done all we could to safeguard against flooding, but acknowledged the pooling that happens on the road.\" Hutt City Council spokesperson Brad Monaghan said the following in a statement to Te Manu Kōrihi: \"Kōkiri Marae has asked Council to pay for drainage work on their property in the past. \"Council's understanding is that the onsite pipes on the Marae do not have sufficient capacity to service the Marae operation. \"Council has worked with the Marae to provide advice and design options for the work required, but believes that the responsibility for this work lies with the property owner. The Marae has not progressed with this work. \"Council is happy to continue to talk with Kokiri Marae to help progress work to alleviate the issue in the future, including providing more materials such as sandbags to protect the Marae in the case of future flooding.\" However, Ms Olsen-Ratana said it was the road drainage rather than the marae's onsite pipes that were the problem and that this was where the flooding originated from. \"The road is not on our land and it is from there primarily that the water flows back onto the marae. It was that storm water system we wanted them to fix and pay for.\"","","","Māori in Lower Hutt have spent the day bailing rainwater out of Kōkiri marae, in a desperate attempt to reduce damage from the storm that has caused chaos in the Wellington region. The water started pouring into the marae in Seaview at around 12pm, and people have been using pillows and mattresses as sandbags to try and soak up the water. The marae's general manager, Tina Olsen-Ratana, said the babies in its kōhanga reo were evacuated first. She said there was alarm as the waters rose. \"People were yelling from all sides of the marae that water was starting to come in through the walls. The water was coming from every angle into the marae. \"The road is all under water and parts inside are up to my knees.\" Ms Olsen-Ratana said they rang the Fire Service, but all it could do was check the gutters and drains were clear of rubbish. She said the problem was not that the drains are blocked, but that because of the built up areas of development around the marae, it now sits at the lowest point. Their next step was to ring Hirepool to get a pump so they could keep up with the deluge of rain, but she said Hirepool was unable to get to the marae because of the blocked roads. \"We had a little pump here and we were trying to pump it out, and the water was subsiding, but then the rain started again.\" Ms Olsen-Ratana said nearly 100 people have been helping them. \"We've had people come from Wellington, they've heard through Facebook or Twitter or whatever, and they're starting to flood in to help.\" She said the students and staff all stripped down, got barefoot, and grabbed any container they could find to bail out the water. \"I keep telling them it's better to run around in your undies than run around in your pants and get wet.\" Ms Olsen-Ratana said they put music on to keep people's spirits up, but now the reality of the damage was sinking in. \"As the rain keeps coming everyone is getting a bit sad, we are just moving like an arm,y really. There's no time to be sad, we have just got to do the best we can.\" She said people had to be sent home to get dry clothes, but all they wanted to do was stay and protect the marae which they see as their taonga [treasure]. Ms Olsen-Ratana said they had used every pillow and mattress they could find as sandbags to hold the water back, but were worried about how much rain is yet to come. \"We've got those vacuum things to try and suck excess water out of the mattresses so we can use them for the next downpour.\" She said they have no idea yet of the scale of the clean-up or the cost. \"There is going to be a hell of a mess to clean up after all this. Where I'm sitting it's looking like a disaster zone.\"","Wellington is in chaos from flooding tonight, with people warned against trying to get home as both highways and trains are severely hit. Most road and rail links in and out of the capital are closed, and those that are open are painfully slow. At one stage, the only way out was a circuitous route north on State Highway 1 until Paremata, then taking the Haywards Hill Road through to the Hutt Valley. People struck in Wellington overnight because of the rain storms battering the region are being urged to call the Wellington City Council if they can't find accommodation. The mayor Celia Wade Brown said the council's welfare team would be helping people struck in the city to find a place to stay. Flooding forced the closure of Wellington Railway Station, so no trains were running in or out of the capital until at least tomorrow afternoon. A dozen schools in the region closed early, and some expected to be closed tomorrow. The rain was easing after 117 millimetres fell in Kapiti in 24 hours, and 96 millimetres in Lower Hutt - but more was expected tomorrow. Stranded in the city, Petone commuter and mother of two Helen van Rijswijk took to a private boat across the harbour to Eastbourne. \"It's just a guy who has hired the boat, charging people $10 for the trip and he's taking them over to Eastborne,\" she told Checkpoint. \"There's 80 people on this boat and I was the second-to-last person allowed on. \"I live in Alicetown and there's no buses, no trains, so it was stay at work or try to get home one way or another. I didn't fancy sleeping the night in the office.\" Abby Field, who was attempting her usual 40-minute trip from Wellington to Paremata got stuck in motorway traffic for three hours - at one stage not moving for nearly an hour. \"I've seen people walking past me, people get out and stretch and just kind of take in the rain,\" she said. She had seen people driving up the bank and on to the southbound motorway lane to try to get home. \"I haven't seen it this bad, I don't think, ever.\" People at a Lower Hutt marae were frantically trying to bail out rainwater. The water started pouring into Kokiri Marae at about midday and people have been using pillows and mattresses as sandbags to try to soak up the water. Marae general manager Tina Olsen-Ratana said there was alarm as the waters rose, and the babies in its kohanga reo were evacuated first. Everyone was alarmed as the water seeped through the walls, reaching up to the adults' knees. \"People were out there with buckets - any container we could find was being used to try and bucket it away,\" she said. \"It was like being on a sinking ship.\" Hotels in Wellington booked up fast, with phones ringing non-stop as people are told to stay put and not to return to their Kapiti Coast homes. A spokesperson for Ibis Hotel in Wellington said they went from a few rooms taken to fully booked in a few hours. It had had to start turning people away and had dealt with more than 30 people in the past hour. Other central city hotels, including James Cook, Amora and Bolton, had also booked out and had had to turn several dozen people away.","The remnants of Cyclone Pam continues to batter the Chatham Islands, cutting power to about 40 households after a tree fell on power lines. A state of emergency is in place, with the occupants of up to 20 coastal homes ordered to leave their properties as a precaution yesterday still unable to go home. Winds peaked at about 80 kilometres an hour, with gusts of up to nearly 110 kilometres this morning. Mayor Alfred Preece said some elderly residents without power were moved to a welfare centre for the night. \"We've got power back on to the EOC [Emergency Operation Centre]. The power for the other consumers is expected to be back on probably late tomorrow at the earliest but it could be Thursday morning.\" Mr Preece said a wharf, at the north end of the island, had been badly damaged and some house had suffered minor damage. Many families on the island have taken refuge at Kopinga Marae. One resident said many of the roads had been flooded out or strewn with debris; she was staying at home because it was impossible to make it back to the marae. She said the island had been battered so hard by the storm that it snapped the flag pole at Kopinga Marae. She said making and receiving phone calls had been touch and go, and she was using a CB radio to keep in contact with the marae and Civil Defence. In the meantime, families at the marae were being fed, kept entertained by DVDs and were keeping calm as the storm passed over. Mr Preece said it was fortunate the Chatham Islands had plenty of warning of Pam's approach. \"We've asked people to secure their properties and make sure things like trampolines are tied down,\" he said. \"And the fishing community have shifted their boats and secured their boats on higher grounds, those that are one trailers.\" The storm was expected to lie about 260 kilometres northeast of the Chatham Islands early this afternoon and just to the east later tonight. MetService warned residents there to prepare for severe gales, heavy rain and large swells. They were also urged to ensure they had enough food and clean water to last several days. Earlier, Kaingaroa Village resident Chris Morrison said the community was well-prepared for stormy weather but this looked like it could be serious. \"At this stage, it's probably bigger now than anything we've seen, certainly since 1986 when the last significant damage occurred here.\" Local schools were closed and will likely remain closed tomorrow. MetService warned high winds, rain and heavy swells could last until Wednesday night. The Civil Defence Minister said the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) would be available to help out in the Chatham Islands if needed. Nikki Kaye said she had been in touch with the NZDF to let them know they may be needed in the Chathams, depending on the severity of the storm. The now ex-cyclone pounded the East Coast of the North Island yesterday closing roads and forcing evacuations. It also devastated Vanuatu over the weekend, destroying buildings and killing 24 people.","As the Prime Minister prepares to head to Waitangi this week the new chairperson of Waitangi Marae says he can expect plain-speaking and robust discussion, but no abuse. Prominent kuia Emma Gibbs was recently elected chair of the marae trustees. She said her aim was to uphold the traditional values of a marae that was originally built by women to honour the Treaty and welcome important visitors. Emma Gibbs is best known and well-respected for her long campaign to clean up the waters of the Bay of Islands. She is also a great-great-granddaughter of the formidable chief Te Kemara who signed the Treaty of Waitangi 175 years ago this Friday. Her grandmother was on the women's committee that raised the funds to build the meeting house. Two weeks ago she was elected to head the new trustees to run the marae. For the past 13 years the troubled marae has had interim trustees, appointed by the Maori Land Court, but Ms Gibbs said now the home-people are back in charge. \"There's no doubt there are personality clashes, but I refuse to take them on board because the most important thing is the 175 anniversary,\" she said. Two of the new Waitangi Marae trustees are the activist Hinewhare Harawira and her partner Waireti Paora. That has sparked predictions there could be trouble when the politicians visit Waitangi this week. Ms Harawira went to prison in 1995 for spitting on the Governor-General. But Emma Gibbs said people change. \"Hinewhare is whanau and she and her partner were democratically elected.\" Ms Gibbs said now the marae was back under local control the offers of expert help had been flooding in from the home people. \"They're offering for us to utilise, to redevelop the face of our marae. Our marae's always had the mana, but to redevelop the face of the real people at home and so that we can manaaki, the visitor the manuhiri - in the traditional manner,\" she said. Mrs Gibbs said that meant robust face-to-face exchanges, but not abuse or physical attacks. Waitangi is the place where Maori frustrations have a history of boiling over. Ngati Hine chairman Pita Tipene says this year feelings are running high over the Waitangi Tribunal's sovereignty report, which he says the government has largely ignored. There is also the deep rift within Ngapuhi over who has a mandate to settle the iwi's treaty claims. \"There are some people who are really angry about a whole range of things up here in Tai Tokerau, let alone the rest of the country. And I think it will be expressed when the Prime Minister arrives at the marae on February the 5th and into the 6th.\" The traditional protest hikoi from the Far North will arrive at Waitangi about midday on Thursday, with a focus this year on deep sea oil drilling. There will be a more festive hikoi on Waitangi Day when the Navy holds its first charter parade in the north. Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Jack Steer, said the Navy was granted the freedom of Tai Tokerau in a charter in 1990, giving it the right to march through the streets of Paihia with the band playing, flags flying, and bayonets fixed. \"A charter parade, it's a big deal to organise it and it's our way of honouring the relationship we have and that's what we wanted to do in this special year of 175th anniversary,\" he said. The Navy is sending four ships to the Bay of Islands to mark the special anniversary and record numbers of waka are also expected. The Governor-General and the Navy contingent will be welcomed onto the Waitangi marae this morning.","An Auckland marae which was going to be part of multimillion-dollar plans for a New Zealand theme park in China has been told the project has been dropped. Awataha Marae on Auckland's North Shore said it was going to supplying carvings, taonga and performers for the Maori cultural village at the 25-square-kilometre park in Qufu in north-eastern Shandong province. When it was first announced in 2009, the project was said to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars and expected to create hundreds of jobs for New Zealanders. But in 2010, there were reports of delays due to difficulties in pulling together project components, poor weather and flooding. Awataha Marae chief executive Anthony Wilson said he had still not not been given a satisfactory explanation as to why it was dumped. Mr Wilson said he was told that the project leaders wanted to take it in a new direction by putting in a golf course and hotel.","A contentious council project to lay a sewerage pipe through Māori land in Tauranga has come to a head again this week after construction caused flooding in the rural area of Matapihi. A burst water main caused flooding on the main road on Monday, which residents say blocked access to homes, the marae and the kohanga reo. The Tauranga City Council said the flooding was caused during construction on its $102 million Southern Pipeline. Matapihi resident Hinemarie Burton said the community has nothing to gain from the pipe, as they would remain on sewerage tanks even after it is finished. Ms Burton said residents do not feel that the council has communicated with them enough. An injunction application has been filed with the Māori Land Court against the laying of the pipe. A hearing is likely to be set down before 22 December.","Civil Defence Minister Nikki Kaye is supporting Northland iwi in their plans to talk about marae being used as hubs in an emergency. Te Tai Tokerau has been hit by widespread damage caused by flooding. Iwi chairs are expected to meet next month to discuss which marae could be used as civil defence hubs, such as being used for a place to sleep or to shower. The minister, Nikki Kaye, said there were already a number of marae across the country which were part of civil defence responses, and welcomed the move to use more. She said it was important that iwi were part of the plans in what happened in an emergency.","Te Tai Tokerau iwi chairs have started talking about developing a collaborative civil defence plan to help their Northland people in future. The region has suffered widespread damage caused by flooding. Te Runanga o Te Rarawa chief executive Kevin Robinson said respective iwi were doing their bit and helping their tribal members. But iwi chairs and their chief executives had started talking about how they could use iwi resources and better co-ordinate with local government, he said. They wanted to look at the Marae which had generators and said they could be used by people who experienced extensive power outages. Further talks on creating a civil defence strategy were expected to take place early next month, Mr Robinson said.","Civil Defence staff are on the alert in storm-battered Northland, as more heavy rain and high winds are forecast. Rural settlements are cut off by floodwaters and hundreds of people face a fourth night without power. A heavy rain and wind warning is in force for the region until 9am on Saturday and Civil Defence is monitoring conditions as communities from Kaitaia to Kawakawa brace for flooding. Power companies warned residents they should prepare for the possibility of widespread cuts overnight. Near Kaitaia, the river is over the main road at Fairfield late on Friday night, and there are fears it could flood in the town if the rain is intense. The Far North District Council's Civil Defence officer, Alistair Wells, says people in flood-prone spots have either moved out or hunkered down, ready for a rough night. Police, the Fire Service and district councils have all rostered extra staff on to keep watch as the record five-day storm delivers its parting shot. The MetService says the front moving onto Northland may produce localised downpours of 40mm an hour - along with the risk of a small tornado. It's warning of gale-force north-easteries and severe thunderstorms, mainly in eastern areas. MetService says if any tornados occur, they'll affect very localised areas, but may cause some structural damage including damage to trees and power lines. It says the front should lie over southern Auckland by midday on Saturday and the rain should ease to showers in Northland by the afternoon. The fierce storm which began on Tuesday has already caused millions of dollars of damage, Civil Defence said. Floods and power cuts have made some treatment plants useless and Civil Defence officials say contaminated drinking water could be a concern in the coming days. About 1600 customers are without power and many are in communities cut off by floodwaters, making line repairs difficult. Top Energy said 1000 of its customers don't have electricity on Friday night, but most should have power restored by Saturday, or Monday at the latest. Phone and internet services have also been badly hit, with 12 Telecom and nine Vodafone cellphone towers out of action across Northland. About 3000 people were without landlines or internet on Friday. At least 500 people have been cut off in rural settlements south of the Northland town of Kawakawa on Friday night. The communities of Motatau, Matawaia and Opahi have been isolated since the storm began, without phone, power or internet. Civil Defence volunteer Mike Butler said six families had to leave their properties in Otiria Road near Moerewa on Friday afternoon as streams converged around them. Floodwaters lapped at the doors of the Otiria marae and whanau moved the contents to safety. Mr Butler said two people from the settlement of Opahi had to walk 25km to Moerewa for groceries. Motatau elder Kevin Prime said the valley is used to floods and they're usually short-lived, but four days without power is creating hardship for some. Civil Defence controller Alistair Wells said it was the duration of the storm that was causing problems and the eventual cost to the region would be millions of dollars. \"In terms of flooding events we've had, in isolated areas, more serious ones in recent years but the consistency across the district and the duration of it is the point of concern at the moment.\" Mr Wells told Radio New Zealand's Checkpoint programme on Friday more rain on already sodden ground will only make matters worse and could case flooding and more trees to fall. He asked people not to travel if they could possibly help it and to contact Civil Defence early for help on 0800 920 029. People in the region, particularly the Far North, are being advised to conserve water in case there are problems with the supply. District council spokesman Bill Hutchinson told Morning Report some of the pumps, particularly in Kawakawa, were completely under water. Contingency plans were being put in place and the council was working with the Fire Service to access the more difficult rural areas affected. Northland's rescue helicopter trust said it could help out people stranded by floodwaters - but it hasn't been asked by Civil Defence. Police are asking motorists to drive with extreme care and not venture out unless they have to. Dozens of roads across Northland remain closed on Friday night, including two State Highways, while others have been damaged by rain. Flooding has closed State Highway 11 just north of Kawakawa and State Highway 12 north of Dargaville. State Highway 1 is down to one lane over the three bridges between Kawakawa and Moerewa. About 50 council roads between Whangarei and Kaitaia are closed due to floods, slips and fallen trees. Kaeo resident Geoff Stone, who commutes to Kaitaia for work, said the roads are getting softer by the day, but heavy vehicles including logging trucks are still using them. Mr Stone said potholes are developing in many places, posing a sometimes invisible risk and he spent several hours this week helping a driver who'd hit a hole and blown several tyres.","I intend to remove the following companies from the Register under section 318(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1993.

their own supply of clean, safe drinking water. Marara Rogers-Koroheke from Hauora Hokianga says the community set up its own water pipelines and storage tanks to bring clean water down from the mountains to a marae after floods in 1999 polluted their normal supply. Ms Rogers-Koroheke says the scheme expanded with the help of Nga Puhi and Te Rawara to provide water to all of the 9000 people in the community. She says the Government recognised its success by setting up a $50 million programme where funding is provided for clean water projects designed by small rural communities like Hokianga. National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research freshwater scientist Chris Tanner says the work in Hokianga is inspiring and deserving of wider recognition.","An Agreement in Principle to address cultural concerns by a Te Arawa hapu about a Rotorua lake is due to be signed off soon. Ngati Pikiao appealed against a resource consent which expired last year and related to the Okere Gates at Lake Rotoiti near Rotorua. It opposed the request because Bay of Plenty Regional Council sought to keep the gates, which the sub-tribe says raises the water level and occasionally floods some marae and cemeteries. Instead it prefers a staircase system so heavy rain can automatically run out of the lake. Council environmental hazards group manager Ken Tarboton says he can't give details but the Agreement in Principle document recognises hapu concerns. He says it shows the council is committed to dealing with those issues. Ngati Pikiao says the agreement will provide a real sense that it has an input into the way the lake is managed.","A Te Arawa hapu wants water-level control gates at Lake Rotoiti near Rotorua lake removed to help stop some marae and urupa (burial grounds) being flooded during heavy rain. Ngati Pikiao appealed against a resource consent by the Bay of Plenty Regional Council which wants to retain the Okere Radial Gates that allow the council to control the water level during heavy rain and stop water flowing down the Kaituna River. Hapu spokesperson Kepa Morgan argues that the gates are not necessary. He says the council raises the water level to make it more navigable for boaties and jetskiers but that results in flooding of the lake beaches and reduces the numbers of native species in the lake, such as inanga or whitebait. He says use of the gates has also caused occasional flooding of marae and urupa. Dr Kepa Morgan says the hapu has recommended a weir be installed instead but the regional council says that won't allow them to control the water level. An Agreement in Principle is due to be signed off by Council giving its commitment to address the cultural concerns.","","","A Bay of Plenty , whose marae is threatened by flooding from the Waikato river, has refused Contact Energy's offer to re-locate to a safe site. Ngati Tahu's marae at Ohaaki, northeast of Taupo, has been sinking since 1992 due to underground steam extraction by a nearby power station. The ground has subsided almost 3.7 metres and now stands just a metre and a half above the level of the Waikato river. Contact Energy, which owns the nearby Ohaaki Geothermal Power Plant, offered to pay for the marae to be moved to land beside the Taupo-Rotorua highway. Hapu administrator Aroha Campbell says a working party was given a mandate to come up with recommendations for the marae's future a year ago. She says those recommendations were presented to a hui at the weekend and rejected, which means the marae will stay where it is. Aroha Campbell says the hui did not make a decision as to what to do with the small meeting house or wharenui.","","I intend to remove the following companies from the Register under section 318(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1993.I am satisfied that these companies have ceased to carry on business and there is no other reason for these companies to continue in existence or that no liquidator is acting.$5 MAGIC LIMITED.0314 LIMITED.0508 FAHEY TEMPORARY FENCING LIMITED.0800 MR BUILDER LIMITED.1 MAN WENT 2 MOW LIMITED.100% NEW ZEALAND WINE LIMITED.123 PRODUCTS LIMITED.127 COLLINS LIMITED.157 PROPERTIES LIMITED.1708 INVESTMENTS LIMITED.2 MAX LIMITED.2139018 LIMITED.2188498 LIMITED.2197787 LIMITED.21ST CENTURY PROMOTIONS LIMITED.2216218 LIMITED.2-2-MANY DIAL-A-DRIVER LIMITED.267 REMUERA ROAD LIMITED.27 CRUMMER  LIMITED.27 DEGREES LIMITED.2CHEAP LIMITED.2G LIMITED.2K 3B LIMITED.2ND EMPIRE INVESTMENTS LIMITED.3 M COMPANY LIMITED.303 CAFE LIMITED.32 WAIWETU LIMITED.360 MARKETING LIMITED.39 WEEKS LIMITED.3AM CLOTHING LIMITED.3F FANATICAL FLAIR FINISHES LIMITED.3GEN LIMITED.4 COWS LIMITED.4 FUNKY PAWS LIMITED.4 HIM HOLDINGS LIMITED.4 P'S LIMITED.4 S TRUSTEES LIMITED.4 SEASONS NAIL LIMITED.4 US 4 INVESTMENTS LIMITED.40 ABOVE LIMITED.43 DEGREES INVESTMENT GROUP LIMITED.446 LIMITED.4711 INVESTMENTS LIMITED.475 PARNELL ROAD LIMITED.4JNM LIMITED.4PL LIMITED.4PO LIMITED.4WD ACCESSORIES LIMITED.520 Q STREET LEVIN LIMITED.58 NORFOLK ST LIMITED.6 MM SIEVE LIMITED.66 VICTORIA AVENUE LIMITED.666 BREWING CO LIMITED.697 LIMITED.7 DAY DEALS LIMITED.7 TO 8 LIMITED.7 X 7 LIMITED.775 LIMITED.786 C H ENTERPRISES LIMITED.8 ON QUAY LIMITED.8888IMPORT LIMITED.8A CONSTABLE STREET LIMITED.9 ZEROS LIMITED.976478 LIMITED.A & A INSTALLATIONS LIMITED.A & C JONES LIMITED.A & C TRANSLATIONS NEW ZEALAND LIMITED.A & D WESTGATE LIMITED.A & J HELICOPTER SERVICES LIMITED.A & P PARMAR LIMITED.A & SB INVESTMENTS LIMITED.A & T MCNAUGHTON TRUSTEES LIMITED.A 2 B SOLUTIONS LIMITED.A B S TECHNOLOGY LIMITED.A BETTER MOVING COMPANY LIMITED.A CRACKER NZ LIMITED.A D S INVESTMENTS LIMITED.A E S GRAPHICS LIMITED.A F JOHNSTON ELECTRICAL (2006) LIMITED.A GREEN FUTURE LIMITED.A H YORK DENTAL LIMITED.A J BUSINESS LIMITED.A J STEWART LIMITED.A MAGAN LIMITED.A MURRAY TRUSTEE LIMITED.A N R INVESTMENTS LIMITED.A P M C LIMITED.A PLUS CONSTRUCTION LIMITED.A R GASKIN ENTERPRISES LIMITED.A SQUIRE FENCING LIMITED.A T & N A MAYOR COMPANY LIMITED.A T CONTRACTORS (2008) LIMITED.A TO Z DIGGER HIRE LIMITED.A TO Z TRADING LIMITED.A&D MOODY INVESTMENTS LIMITED.A&E LIMITED.A.C.

More than 100 members of the sub-tribe travelled to Wellington on Thursday to sign an agreement in principle with the Crown to settle the claims. The agreement sets out a broad redress package that includes $23 million, part of Opouahi Station and Opouahi scenic reserve, and $2 million to relocate the Tangoio Marae north of Napier. Hapu deputy-chair Tania Hopmins says it is a significant achievement after decades of negotiations and they are particularly pleased the Tongoio Marae is part of the settlement as it is the focal point of their community. Ms Hopmins says, however, one of the pieces of land the hapu has been given back is in a flood zone, so the ironic thing is they are tangata whenua with no whenua or land. She says that is a grievance felt very deeply among her people. The hapu will start negotiations with the Crown towards a Deed of Settlement which will set out the redress in detail, she says.","Contact Energy is preparing to pick up the tab for relocating a marae that's sinking into the ground, north of Taupo. Ngati Tahu say Ohaaki marae has dropped 3.7 metres since 1992, with the extraction of underground geothermal fluid by Contact's neighbouring power station. The marae's now at risk of flooding by the Waikato River. Contact Energy bought the Ohaaki geothermal power plant, just outside Taupo, from the Crown in the 1990s. As part of the deal the company agreed to mitigate further subsidence and move the marae if necessary. It says the cost is unknown as yet, and discussions are continuing with the iwi.","The return of a master carver means Te Rereatukahia Marae in Katikati can finally get carvings for its meeting house. Tohunga whakairo Morris Wharekawa says that since returning home, he has been flooded with requests from marae in the western Bay of Plenty wanting carvings. He told Waatea News that giant totara slabs were donated for the project more than 20 years ago by the late Doug Baker. They were held in storage while Mr Wharekawa trained and worked as a carpenter in Auckland, and he then learned the art of carving. He said the hapu had instructed him on the ancestors they want represented.","Motorists should avoid driving to the Coromandel Peninsula because of flooding on the roads, say police. State Highway 25 is closed in several places on the peninsula after 160 millimetres of rain fell in the past 24 hours. Another 90mm is expected before Saturday morning. Police say the area from the one-lane bridge at Marae Road to Goldfields Road, just south of Coromandel, is under half a metre of water and things are predicted to get worse. Caution is also being advised along other parts of State Highway 25 between Thames and Hikuai. Manaia Road, Te Rerenga and Mcleods Straight near Whitianga are closed. Hauraki District Council says the peninsula is cut off and motorists should avoid driving. Heavy rain is expected in Gisborne and Hawke's Bay in the next few days.","Thursday's headlines: Patea Maori Club hoping for a cash windfall as Poi E rises in the music charts; prison project casts shadow across Mt Eden; elective surgery at Wellington hospital to be cut for a week while staff are sent on leave to save money. The New Zealand Herald reports a $218 million prison development towering over the southern motorway and casting a shadow across Mt Eden has horrified residents, schools and community leaders. The building will provide 554 additional beds, but Auckland City Mayor John Banks describes it as a an architectural monstrosity. The Engineering, Printing &amp; Manufacturing Union wants workers to be paid more if statutory holidays fall on a weekend. It says the way the holidays fall is unfair and should be addressed. Auckland Zoo will ban smoking from Saturday, amidst what the paper calls the growing wave of opposition at outdoor venues. The Dominion Post says elective surgery and other services at Wellington hospital will be cut for a week when staff are sent on leave to save money. The Government-owned farming company Landcorp may bid for 16 big North Island farms at the centre of controversy over their potential sale to a Chinese-backed investor. The Patea Maori Club is hoping for a cash windfall as Poi E rises in the music charts. The Taranaki club says the cash from royalties will help young people to learn kapa haka and assist local marae. Poi E is at number three on the charts this week. The Press reports Christchurch escaped with minor flooding after more than a month's rain fell in less than 24 hours. Police say a female cyclist killed near Christchurch on Wednesday was a hit-and-run victim. Christchurch ratepayers could be hit with a $28 million bill for the city's share of a leaky-homes package. After three days of heavy rain causing widespread flooding throughout North Otago, Dunedin and the Taieri Plain, The Otago Daily Times reports Civil Defence is now bracing for a cold snap and snow. Staff at the University of Otago College of Education fear a cost-cutting restructuring proposal announced on Wednesday will result in poorer-quality programmes for teacher trainees.","","A multimillion-dollar deal is being finalised to relocate a historical marae from the banks of the Waikato River to save it from being flooded. Since production wells were drilled at the Ohaaki Power Station site in the Bay of Plenty 30 years ago, the ground surface around the marae has dropped by about 17 centimetres a year. The land where Ohaaki Marae is located is projected to be under water within a decade as it drops below the river level. Contact Energy says stopping geothermal energy production would not prevent the marae from sinking further. A working party is finalising a land swap deal estimated at more than $6 million to save the marae. A neighbouring farmer will also receive about $650,000 in compensation. The deal is expected to be signed on 12 September.
