# Working toward a database of extreme weather impacts to Māori  

The whakahura-marangai repository compiles Sally Owen's work scraping and documenting korero, images and videos of extreme weather impacts in Aotearoa New Zealand which impacted our indigenous peoples or indigenous cultural infrastructure. 

This work was catalysed by Dr Shaun Awatere, Vision Mātauranga leader of the Whakahura: Extreme Weather Events and the Emergence of Climate Change research project, funded by Hīkina Whakatutuki: the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment. Credit also to VM team members Dr John Reid & Dr Matt Rout, as well as Prof Ilan Noy, for initial support, and encouragement, advice and guidance.
